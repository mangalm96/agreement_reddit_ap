802	Agreement	OP, making this vaccine is most likely a waste of money. All figures tell us that it is way outperformed by Comirnaty.  These data is in line with current conclusion that mRNA vaccines are way better than inactivated vaccines in terms of the depth and breadth of antibodies raised.  Another critical issue is that it did not have any Omicron data.  Other inactivated platforms have already shown that using acestral strain raises no or minimal neutralizing effect against the Omicron variant even after giving a booster, I don't expect this vaccine would make any difference.
793	Agreement	Note that the "fully vaccinated" group includes booster shots without breaking them out. Also VE has always stayed quite high in this data, probably because of both the vaccines and big behavioral differences between the vaxxed and unvaxxed.
859	Agreement	thats not clear, IMO mainly cause the mechanisms for LC itself are not clear.
612	Agreement	Also, like with the Norway cluster, they all experienced symptoms. Although with these being healthcare workers and monitoring symptoms down to 1 day, they would have been sharper about it to the point of possible false-positive for *symptoms* when true positive for disease.
47	Agreement	Assuming it is true that mRNA vaccines have a higher risk of causing myocarditis in males younger than 40, not all myocarditis is the same. It seems the myocarditis that you get from natural infection is much more severe.  In either case, it is rare. But what is less rare is having other kinds of cardiac injury. Any Cardiac injury for Covid-19 is in the 19-28% range.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988375/#Sec13title](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988375/#Sec13title)  Also, COVID-19 has a lot of other negative side-effects and long-term risks.
883	Agreement	There is the possibility that the vaccinated people around patients like this are providing the selective pressure, moreso than the patients themselves; ie. many variants will arise in such a patient, but only vaccine resistant ones would be able to transmit onwards.  I'm not sure what you could do about this though, as the same would apply to variants that are capable of breakthrough infections -- now that we have some fairly effective treatments approved, hopefully these chronic infections can be cured?
284	Disagreement	Finally being dragged kicking and screaming over the line. Hope the claims they made about being able to make an Omicron-specific one pretty much immediately weren't just bluster.
469	Disagreement	Not exactly, it looks like they are talking about symptomatic infection.   So 67% chance you won't even know you've got it.
977	Disagreement	I don‚Äôt think there is sufficient information to come to that conclusion.  The delta was small and the confidence intervals with BA.2 are huge.
660	Agreement	Endemic means continuously present in a given population or area without new introduction. It has nothing to do with severity.
578	Agreement	1991 cases out of 192 million persons or more than 359 million doses
303	Disagreement	No it only helps strengthem the body it doesn't mean it helps against covid lol
828	Agreement	So is this better or worse than the mRNA vaccines?
274	Agreement	You are stating the obvious. At some point syphilis changed or we did. Smallpox was called small in relation to the great pox that was laying waste to a continent with a different course of disease vs more recent untreated cases. MERS, SARS and COVID19 are in the same family as are at least two or three seasonal nuisance (cold like) versions.   What makes them different, similar. SARS  changed somehow mid course, of being a worst case pandemic nightmare to essentially disappearing virtually overnight. Why? Why hasn't MERS been able to crossover like SARS at first and Covid ongoing?   That is an EPI perspective from the front end. Somebody take the genomic understanding we now have on Covid and look Comparatively...at least.
84	Agreement	Good point. But did the current study derive 19% from the 5.4 fold number or vice versa?
580	Agreement	4th dose actually seemed to result in antibody levels lower than 3rd dose: per the abstract ‚ÄúThe peak RBD-NAbs level induced by the 4th dose was inferior to the peak of the 3rd dose.‚Äù
230	Agreement	This study wasn't meant to detect efficacy so any positive efficacy signal is just a cherry on top. We know from many many other data sources that vaccines are a durable way to prevent disease, but aren't particularly effective in preventing infection over the long term.
805	Agreement	Page 12:  >**Effect of a vaccine booster on occurrence of COVID-19 in multivariable analyses**   >   >Boosting with a COVID-19 vaccine designed for an earlier variant was associated withsignificantly reduced risk of infection with the Omicron variant in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, among people previously vaccinated (Table 3) or previously infected for whom it was more than 6 months past their prior infection or vaccination (Table 4).   >   >When the effect of number of vaccine doses was analyzed in multivariable analysis, for individuals with natural immunity, there was no advantage to more than one dose of vaccine, and those who received two doses were at significantly higher risk of getting COVID-19 than those who received a single dose (Table 5), supporting the findings of the unadjusted comparison visually depicted in figure 4.  When you look at figure 4, you see that 1 and 3 doses reduced risk, but 2 doses increased risk - that's why I'd like to see what others find.
585	Neutral	Abstract   Genome sequencing proved to be an excellent tool to monitor the molecular epidemiology of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, i.e., coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Some reports of infected, vaccinated individuals have aroused great interest because they are primarily being infected with circulating variants of concern (VOCs). To investigate the cases of infected, vaccinated individuals in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, we performed genomic monitoring to estimate the magnitude of the different VOCs in these cases. Nasopharyngeal swabs from infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic), fully vaccinated individuals (n=29) who were of varying age and had RT-qPCR Ct values of ‚â§30 were subjected to viral sequencing using Nanopore technology. Our analysis revealed that the Omicron variant was found in 99% of cases and that only one case was due to the Delta variant. **Infected, fully vaccinated patients have a favorable clinical prognosis; however, within the community, they become viral carriers with the aggravating factor of viral dissemination of VOCs not neutralized by the vaccines.**
714	Agreement	I wonder if this is more about heterologous vaccination rather than a property of the particular vaccines.  Would be curious to see other combinations as well.
740	Agreement	Interesting to see the high levels of neutralization to omicron in the adult boost study. Wonder if it's due to different immunogenicity of VLPs compared to just spike proteins alone.
911	Agreement	unless the data is age adjusted it wont work.  and that is just the starting point.
118	Agreement	Is there a similar study using UK participants who had their first and second shots 8 weeks apart?
350	Agreement	At the 8-month mark Sweden had an adult vaccination rate of >80%. While it does look very odd I suppose there could be some confounding bias, like maybe vaccinated individuals will expose themselves to more pathogen as they consider the pandemic over with on their part. A lot of COVID19 restrictions also do not apply to the vaccinated, so that could be a factor as well.
719	Agreement	I'm still unsure as to whether Omicron is overall better or worse than Delta, considering the fact it is so much more contagious. I do hope you are right.
151	Agreement	OK so in this case it would be worth it if you can avoid infection to hold off a bit longer. Quite hard  with a 10r but yeah.
390	Agreement	Pfizer seems to have notified the FDA
75	Agreement	Does the FDA ever approve a vaccine with a trial run outside the US in modern day?
417	Agreement	What does this mean for kids age 5-11 who just recently got their two jabs?
41	Agreement	And willing to get vaccinated and be part of a study.
725	Agreement	I‚Äôm not sure how possible it is to get the general population to understand or estimate risk.  A host of cognitive biases work against understanding risk (I won‚Äôt rehearse them), and newspapers are written at about a 6th grade level (some lower) for a reason.   What stood out to me: 1) diverse and (especially!) negative narratives were more compelling to undecideds, 2) smaller pages were underestimated by pro-vaccination groups, and 3) networks of local-with-global pages were involved in successful anti-vaccination networks. 4), not mentioned explicitly but I guess part of 1), this all happens as a result of Facebooks ‚Äúhigh engagement‚Äù algorithms, which push controversial content out because that gets clicks.   I think coming up with compelling and diverse stories that people can understand without having to think statistically is important. Anecdotes (eg about polio, about science heroes).   Negative (fear or anger generating) content is always going to get more engagement. News editors  understand this (‚Äúif it bleeds, it leads‚Äù) and this has been seen in a lot of psych research as well. How do you respond to this?  I would personally like to see more legislation of algorithms pushing high engagement, which I gather the UK is working towards.
685	Agreement	https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-021-00025-3
801	Agreement	One interesting tidbit:  "The level of protection following previous infection was 53.2% for Omicron, and 88.7% for Delta. This level of protection was greater than two doses of vaccine but did not reach levels attained by those who had never had natural infection and had received third dose boosters." So - boosted + never infected > non-vaccinated + infected > 2 doses. I guess that's not too surprising.
594	Neutral	Abstract  Background  Male patients ages 12‚Äì17 years have an elevated risk of mRNA vaccination-associated myo/pericarditis. A risk-benefit analysis of first and second doses of mRNA vaccination in adolescent boys by health status and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been performed.  Methods  Using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), we identified BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] myo/pericarditis occurrence according to CDC criteria. Main outcomes were as follows: 1) post-vaccination myo/pericarditis crude incidence in adolescents aged 12‚Äì15 and 16‚Äì17; and 2) two risk-benefit analyses by age, sex, comorbidity, variant and history of infection.  Results  Cases of myo/pericarditis (n = 253) included 129 after dose 1 and 124 after dose 2; 86.9% were hospitalized. Incidence per million after dose two in male patients aged 12‚Äì15 and 16‚Äì17 was 162.2 and 93.0, respectively. Weighing post-vaccination myo/pericarditis against COVID-19 hospitalization during delta, our risk-benefit analysis suggests that among 12‚Äì17-year-olds, two-dose vaccination was uniformly favourable only in nonimmune girls with a comorbidity. In boys with prior infection and no comorbidities, even one dose carried more risk than benefit according to international estimates. In the setting of omicron, one dose may be protective in nonimmune children, but dose two does not appear to confer additional benefit at a population level.  Conclusions  Our findings strongly support individualized paediatric COVID-19 vaccination strategies which weigh protection against severe disease vs. risks of vaccine-associated myo/pericarditis. Research is needed into the nature and implications of this adverse effect as well as immunization strategies which reduce harms in this overall low-risk cohort.
669	Agreement	For question 1:   You can start by reading Yewdell's review article: [https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1009509](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1009509)  It's an excellent idea why this is the case.
501	Disagreement	When they introduced vaccines they created confusion. Normally with vaccines the 2nd and 3rd dose would both be called booster doses. Using 1st, 2nd, 3rd dose is much less ambiguous.  I understand what you mean, because there was a difference in Moderna. That's because Moderna's dose was quite high so they reduced it in half for safety, but still gave option to get a full dose for immunocompromised people who could benefit from stronger reaction (and since they are cancer patients, they would be eligible for it), but it doesn't look like they talk specifically about Moderna, so I think this distinction is irrelevant in this case.  I think that at this point the consensus is that Moderna should have half the dose it did from the start, so this distinction is likely no longer taken into account in any current research.
619	Agreement	Anyone else thinks that T-cells are far too ignored?
657	Agreement	Does this have anything to do with delta 69-70 in BA1 vs. BA2 (no deletion) - Note that the delta 69-70 also occured in Alpha variant
299	Disagreement	It's not as simple as that. Technically all variants are sublineages of the initial variant. Why aren't vaccines based on that as effective?  BA.2 already has similar amount of mutations compared to original Omicron as there's mutations between Alpha and Delta.   If BA.2 is unable to get through original Omicron's immunity, vaccines might be also able to protect against BA.2, but as the author above said, at the pace of how fast Omicron is getting new mutations due to spreading much faster, it's definitely unclear if there's going to be a new immune evading variant coming out very soon in a public place near you.  Doesn't mean they shouldn't try of course.
766	Agreement	Just in animal models so far. Remember the sage advice of clinical trial veterans. Mice lie. Apes exaggerate.
349	Agreement	As far as i understood this very technical article, the results regard the Pfizer and AstraZeneca tests, does it means the result can be applied to the other vaccine variants since they based on the same working principles ? Or i missed entirely the point ?
347	Agreement	Are US doctors already able to prescribe additional boosters off-label since the Pfizer vaccine has been officially approved, at least for older age groups?
377	Agreement	I wonder if there might be some utility in pursuing these anyways under the assumption that the next problematic variant will be a descendent from the Omicron lineage?   In other words, there may be little gain with Omicron directly, but since these shots update the vaccine to the code of the dominant variant, they may be more protective against immune-evasive descendants of Omicron than the shot that's still based off of the wild-type strain from two years ago.
779	Agreement	My math gave me 0.00001%
741	Agreement	Interesting, so a useful study of course, but perhaps not the full story for humans
810	Agreement	Rapid tests have the exact same problem as vaccines. Variants. If they are of any use the rate of false negatives should be low enough, which appears not to be the case with the current tests and the omicron variant.  This is hopium, we are doomed to all get long-covid unless we develop a better vaccine (90+% against infection).
923	Agreement	Well considering Omicron has higher affinity to ACE2 than Delta and endothelial dysfunction is one of the most prevalent problems in long covid...
275	Disagreement	You need to read the Science short read about the synthesis of paxlovid.   It's the precursor reagents that are badly needed   The reaction needed for each step is documented now.  Mass production is difficult but they're working on it
960	Agreement	You know it still would have been nice to include regimes that used the omicron version as dose 2, and dose 1 and 2. At least you can demonstrate if our efforts actually matter at all when it comes to Omicron protection (and against Delta for that matter).  More macaques, I know, but there are still unvaccinated and undervaccinated people, and would clear information about how "different" the versions really are when it comes to vaccination (opposed to disease.)
899	Agreement	This is already taken into account, compared to an unvaccinated person. Read more about what efficacy, effectiveness and protection mean: https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection  The study was discussed here: https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/rrz28z/vaccine_effectiveness_against_hospital_admission/  > We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine booster in 69 092 HCW as **compared to unvaccinated individuals** enrolled in the same managed care organization using a test negative design. We compared VE against COVID19 admission for omicron during the period 15 November to 20 December 2021. After adjusting for confounders, we observed that VE for hospitalisation increased over time since booster dose, from 63% (95%CI 31-81%); to 84% (95% CI 67-92%) and then 85% (95% CI: 54-95%), 0-13 days, 14-27 days, and 1-2 months post-boost.
171	Disagreement	Seems you've never heard of case studies before.
174	Agreement	Short answer: No.
137	Agreement	It's kind of depressing how bad people are at reading (I'm including myself, I am by no means excluded).
87	Neutral	H1N1 wasn't linear evolution. It was a novel virus with a new antigen that caused the 2009 pandemic.
42	Agreement	Any idea how long post-immunization? As in, immediately after or at what point will it not make a difference?
67	Agreement	Do studies like this typically take into account vaccinated people who previously had Covid?  Is that relevant? Is it possible to account for meaningfully?
241	Agreement	Usually. But for Moderna some places have been doing a half dose (I think it had to do with Moderna using a stronger dose to begin with, but was based on actual data around efficacy and side effects). [At least, that's what we did here in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2021/11/health-canada-authorizes-the-use-of-the-moderna-spikevax-covid-19-vaccine-as-a-booster-shot.html)  But I don't know if this study looked at Canada or even the Moderna vaccine.
546	Agreement	> in their discussion they cite a recent study which shows that the trend toward less NAb generation after each additional "booster" w/ mRNA 1273 seems to be in line w/ their results    In [that study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.22270948v1.full-text), neutralization titers after the 4th dose were slightly higher than after the 3rd dose; there's no "trend towards less NAb generation". It's just that they're not substantially increased, unlike after the 3rd dose when compared with the 2nd.    These results (with mRNA vaccines) are not worrying, they simply suggest that these vaccines need 3 doses to achieve peak humoral immunity and subsequent doses can only bring it back, but not improve. There's no risk of shifting the response away from the spike because that's their only antigen.
969	Disagreement	Am i missing where they‚Äôre coming up with the waning vaccine effectiveness? I can‚Äôt seem to find what interval they‚Äôre saying that, for example, 3 doses of moderna wanes from ~75% to ~65%. Can anybody shine some light on that for me? Thanks!
548	Agreement	> Mixed cocktail seems to work great, specific omicron or delta RBD vaccine protocols didn't work as much.   Howcome the abstract adds this:  > The bivalent RBD-LNP, on the other hand, generated antibody with broadly neutralizing activity against the wild-type virus and all variants. Surprisingly, similar cross-protection was also shown by the Delta-specifc RBD-LNP.  Are they saying the bivalent and Delta-specific ones had similar results against non-omicron variants?  You're saying "delta RBD vaccine protocols didn't work as much" which seems to contradict that.  Can you clarify?
784	Agreement	Not according to this, which was posted to this sub recently. It states 70% against hospitalization.  https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2119270
561	Agreement	>**Abstract**  >The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant sparked concern due to its fast spread and the unprecedented number of mutations in the spike protein that enables it to partially evade spike-based COVID-19 vaccine-induced humoral immunity. In anticipation of a potential need for an Omicron spike-based vaccine, we generated an Ad26 vector encoding an Omicron (BA.1) spike protein (Ad26.COV2.S.529). Ad26.COV2.S.529 encodes for a prefusion stabilized spike protein, similar to the current COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S encoding the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein. We verified that spike expression by Ad26.COV2.S.529 was comparable to Ad26.COV2.S. Immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S.529 was then evaluated in na√Øve mice and SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 spike pre-immunized hamsters. In na√Øve mice, Ad26.COV2.S.529 elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.1) but not to SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2), while the opposite was observed for Ad26.COV2.S. In pre-immune hamsters, Ad26.COV2.S.529 vaccination resulted in robust increases in neutralizing antibody titers against both SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2), while Ad26.COV2.S vaccination only increased neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant. Our data imply that Ad26.COV2.S.529 can both expand and boost a Wuhan-Hu-1 spike-primed humoral immune response to protect against distant SARS-CoV-2 variants.
987	Disagreement	no - "VE against COVID-19‚Äìassociated ED/UC visits"  in the abstract
99	Agreement	I forget where I read it, it might have been something on NPR which I am often listening to, but the key to vaccines is not to prevent you from catching the virus. They are there to reduce the chances of having serious/deadly symptoms. The vaccines will reduce the chances of you having to go to the hospital.  Found it...   [https://health.wusf.usf.edu/npr-health/2022-02-21/as-booster-shot-protections-wane-heres-the-latest-research-on-a-4th-vaccine-dose](https://health.wusf.usf.edu/npr-health/2022-02-21/as-booster-shot-protections-wane-heres-the-latest-research-on-a-4th-vaccine-dose)
971	Disagreement	But the public health recommendations (and in practice mandates) in some countries are given without being based on the data you list. *That* is what I'm strongly against.
219	Agreement	They didn't make a determination. The quote:  >We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of Omicron   Is the same as saying exactly what you said. Stating that they have **no evidence** is simply a statement of exacy that, *not* what you're inferring, which is a pronouncement of "there is no difference in severity", which is *not* what they claimed.
440	Disagreement	Disappointing, but this seems to be for a single dose of the omicron-targeted vaccines.  I recall seeing some speculation about 2 doses of this vaccine. Not ideal when you consider the effort to produce and roll out 2 doses, especially considering booster uptake has been low. Still, there's at least some hope.
348	Agreement	are you sure they don't mean the decline of the booster Pfizer is after 10 weeks ?  Or that you are talking about the second dose.  I am talking about the half size booster, didn't think peopel were getting a 3rd shot already in august. I am just reading that it is 1-2 weeks after you booster that anti Body levels spike up.
139	Agreement	It's really shocking how different VE estimates are across regions depending on the demographics of the vaccinated vs unvaccinated in those regions.  The sharp drop in case-negative measured efficacy against Delta in the US is the exact opposite of what UK HSA measured.    Confounding factors seem to make case-negative studies no longer useful.  But they're all we have so here we are.
577	Agreement	1. Humans don't tend to hold onto antibodies, in general. Individual antibodies don't last very long, and it's very metabolically expensive to keep making antibodies for things that you aren't regularly being exposed to.
336	Agreement	> We just have to accept that while breakthrough infections are going to happen, the memory B and T cells will be in time to stop the infection from becoming severe.  If Covid repeats every year... and every year it divides so much that  a test can detect it, then this is accumulative damage.  edit: Why Is this getting downvoted?  >Often, the virus‚Äôs plentiful progeny punish the good deed of the cell that produced them by lysing it ‚Äî punching holes in its outer membrane, busting out of it and destroying the cell in the process.  >But enveloped viruses can escape by an alternative process called budding, whereby they wrap themselves in a piece of membrane from the infected cell and diffuse through the cell‚Äôs outer membrane without structurally damaging it. Even then, the cell, having birthed myriad baby viruses, is often left fatally weakened.  https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2020issue2/how-coronavirus-destroys-cells-treatments.html  COVID has already significantly lowered our life expectancy. I guarantee you a yearly bout of COVID will lower it further. Maybe significantly.
941	Agreement	With them being healthcare workers, I doubt it was one person infecting 20.
161	Agreement	Plenty of studies on this subject have the exercise done before the injection. Usually arm/weight exercises, portable and easy to do anywhere.
749	Agreement	Isn't Israel concluding that dose 4 isn't holding up?
289	Disagreement	I have some serious issues with this term "viral load."  If the assay for this isn't a culture-based assay (plaque, focus, or TCID50) then I take issue with the use of the term "viral load."  What we have seen from the recent Swiss study is that Ct value is not well correlated to actual infectious virus load and that infections in vaccinated people produce a markedly reduced number of FFU with respect to the unvaccinated, even if PCR Ct values are similar.    We are over two years into this and I want to actually see some culture data, not Ct values.
412	Agreement	What about kids who are vaccinated and subsequently infected by covid?
627	Agreement	At the rate that it‚Äôs spreading, most epidemiological modelling I‚Äôve seen (at least on a country specific level) has indicated it probably wouldn‚Äôt take very long for this in-fact the vast majority of individuals.
334	Agreement	> Results.‚Äì The microscopic examination revealed features resembling a catecholamine-induced injury, not typical myocarditis pathology.    This sounds like a major finding that supports the vaccine - or coronavirus - as a contributing factor. Thoughts?
891	Agreement	They mention asymptomatic infection, so for the purpose of policy and mitigation, which seems to be the point they're making, you can't tell if someone is going to be infectious just based on their vaccination status or even symptomology. Thus the argument for NPI above and beyond vaccination.
909	Agreement	To me, this is another illustration of just how different Omicron is from the WT. based on what we know, I‚Äôm not shocked that an Omicron-only spike doesn‚Äôt great WT antibodies.   The key thing to watch for in the next few days is what this response is like in non-naive individuals. I‚Äôll be watching this space.
824	Agreement	So 150+ the double vaccine is very low in stopping virus?
926	Agreement	What about omicron and long Covid?
979	Disagreement	I‚Äôm confused.   Paper says myocarditis is more likely from covid than the mRNA vaccine, and more likely in the mRNA vaccine than the adenovirus vaccine. And even then it suggests an increase of 12 cases per million doses as opposed to unvaccinated individuals.   Where does anyone get the idea that vaccines are bad from this?
682	Agreement	How would a combination of vaccinations and viral exposures play into this?
107	Agreement	I would imagine the reasoning goes "why would I get a vaccine at this point if I can still catch the virus". People do change their minds, it's been more than one year since their approval and they haven't caused mass death or anything, so they see little risk but little reward too.
505	Disagreement	Wonder if this will be durable at all. [There was a previous study from Qatar where efficacy against infection went to 0 eventually](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114114) and I could never find any explanation for it (maybe the 3 week interval which the US just repeated for 5-12 with no discussion).  It was really one of those studies that made me realize we're just on our own if we want to understand our own immunity (i.e. it's actually impossible without any expertise), as no health authorities and almost no "experts" wanted to touch that study with a 10 foot pole.
199	Neutral	The booster dose is a third normal dose.
967	Disagreement	>hospital (yet)   Get out of here with this if you are trying to correct someone else on what the study's content is.
978	Disagreement	I think the authors of the article are making a similar mistake as many political pundits (from all political sides) tend to make. They reduce a complex issue to two sides. Just like in politics there are actually more than two possible views, in case of vaccinations there are more than two possible views as well.
588	Neutral	Abstract   The highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has been shown to evade a substantial fraction of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by current vaccines that encode the WA1/2020 Spike immunogen, resulting in increased breakthrough infections and reduced vaccine efficacy. Cellular immune responses, particularly CD8+ T cell responses, are likely critical for protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Here we show that cellular immunity induced by current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is highly cross-reactive against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccines demonstrated durable CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses that showed extensive cross-reactivity against both the Delta and Omicron variants, including in central and effector memory cellular subpopulations. Median Omicron-specific CD8+ T cell responses were 82-84% of WA1/2020-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These data suggest that current vaccines may provide considerable protection against severe disease with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant despite the substantial reduction of neutralizing antibody responses.
832	Agreement	So the flu vaccines each year aren't, on average, necessary to prevent severe illness so long as you have a somewhat recent (past couple of decades?) history of exposure or vaccination and aren't in a risk group?
102	Agreement	I think the argument against the Vaccine in regards to myocarditis only lies within the under 40 and male age and sex category.  There was a large study posted on this subreddit that showed males under 40 actually have a higher risk of getting myocarditis from the vaccine than from actually getting Covid.   That said some Vaccines are worse than others so it's more of an argument on which vaccine a male under 40 should get vs should they get vaccinated at all.
356	Agreement	Data suggests the vaccines are as overwhelmingly effective at preventing hospitalization among children as adults, so there are probably too few vaccinated children hospitalized with breakthrough COVID-19 to find a statistically meaningful number of them who are specifically hospitalized with myocarditis, which is one of the rarer symptoms.
206	Agreement	The paper is interesting in what it studied compared to what it is being asserted as evidence for.  The vaccine developed for inducing antibodies for a specific domain then has an assay showing specific antibodies are of higher and greater specificity. However it doesn‚Äôt seem to discuss any utility of broader range of antibody binding targets (which comes from infection) or the fact this was a lab study but makes a strong claim about expected real world outcomes.  Would be interested in what others think of the methodology.
388	Agreement	No one use antivirals for this age group, the risk profile is too low.
704	Agreement	I think the SIREN study is ongoing; There‚Äôs been some studies that looked at boosters, I linked one in a comment above.
522	Neutral	**Abstract**   ____   **BACKGROUND:**   Protection offered by five different forms of immunity, combining natural and vaccine immunity, was investigated against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron symptomatic BA.1 infection, symptomatic BA.2 infection, BA.1 hospitalization and death, and BA.2 hospitalization and death, in Qatar, between December 23, 2021 and February 21, 2022.      **METHODS:**   Six national, matched, test-negative case-control studies were conducted to estimate effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, natural immunity due to prior infection with pre-Omicron variants, and hybrid immunity from prior infection and vaccination.     **RESULTS:**   Effectiveness of only prior infection against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% CI: 39.5-51.9%). Effectiveness of only two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was negligible at -1.1% (95% CI: -7.1-4.6), but nearly all individuals had received their second dose several months earlier. Effectiveness of only three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 52.2% (95% CI: 48.1-55.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.9-58.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 77.3% (95% CI: 72.4-81.4%). Meanwhile, prior infection, BNT162b2 vaccination, and hybrid immunity all showed strong effectiveness >70% against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 due to BA.2 infection. Similar levels and patterns of effectiveness were observed for BA.1 and for the mRNA-1273 vaccine.      **CONCLUSIONS:**   There are no discernable differences in the effects of prior infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity against BA.1 versus BA.2. Hybrid immunity resulting from prior infection and recent booster vaccination confers the strongest protection against either subvariant. Vaccination enhances protection of those with a prior infection.
638	Agreement	Can we call this disease induced- instead of natural- immunity? All immunity is natural after all.  There are indications that asymptomatic infection does *not* induce a full immune response, so  'infection induced' is probably not strong enough.
176	Agreement	So many words to sift through... Can someone tell me what the effectiveness of a 3rd shot of Pfizer is, and how long this effectiveness lasts? Specifically against omicron?
472	Disagreement	One possible explanation are changes in behavior (greater risk taking) after vaccination. But another explanation might simply be small sample size and multiple adjustment in the statistical analysis. That negative effectiveness was estimated based on a total of 112 events in a fully adjusted analysis, which included 14 variables. 112 may not look like a small sample, but it's not much for estimating effects of all 14 variables, so that VE esimate is not very reliable.    Or both explanations may be true.
827	Agreement	So in laymans terms, a vaccine administered via a nose spray appears to be the preferred strategy moving forward?
223	Agreement	This is an area of ongoing research, but the broad outline seems to be understood (though of course there's always the chance we'll learn something new that shifts things significantly).  We know that germinal centers, in which B cells are "trained", iterate towards *both* B cells which can produce the best antibodies for the antigens being observed, *and* B cells that have mutated some random variation into their antibodies.  The former are sent out of the lymph nodes to become plasma cells and make lots of antibodies, while the latter are fed back into the "training" to try to find something better ... and also, some subset of them are turned into memory B cells, to hang around for the future.  Memory B cells are therefore produced with a bunch of random variations, which is believed to be intended as a head start against future variants.  We also know, though with less confidence, that after some time, memory B cells become dormant, and if you challenge the immune system with a similar antigen after that happens, it leads to recruiting more naive B cells into this same process.  It may be that this leads to creating memory B cells with more variation than if you'd challenged the immune system when most of the previous challenge's memory B cells were still active.  Here I think I'm getting into the vaguer parts of current understanding.  One way or another, each challenge does cause more germinal center activity, which means more memory B cells with random variations branched off the "best" current antibody.  But it also seems that giving a challenge a sufficient amount of time after the previous challenge (4 months? 6? 8?) leads to even more variation than one that comes shortly after the previous challenge.  Which means greater breadth.
605	Agreement	After reading through the authors' pair of studies, I think yes there is benefit. Peptide vaccines are a developing modality that theoretically can expand our tools to fight disease. Most of the biotech focus right now seems to be on stimulating T-cells to treat or vaccinate against cancer, but there could be other applications as well.  Also, antigens that preferentially stimulate one type of lymphocyte over another can help elucidate poorly understood areas of immunology. For example, I believe one of the questions these authors explored here is whether T-cell immunity by itself is sufficient to prevent infection or disease from coronavirus infection.
39	Agreement	And also those who obtain hybrid immunity via a breakthrough infection are unlikely to be anything resembling representative - rather by definition, that group is going to have a far larger than representative proportion of those who generated weak immune responses to the vaccines in the first place in it. Indeed, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see naive calculations not taking that into account giving negative protection for that hybrid immunity.
833	Agreement	So they ruled out selective pressure with over vaccinated people?  And blame it on the people for not social distancing enough?
9	Agreement	> But if you see a wave of PR claiming that "well actually it isn't supposed to protect you in those other ways that we've claimed is the primary purpose of other vaccines" then something doesn't smell right  ... especially when the very same people were estimating thresholds for herd immunity beforehand and citing it as the primary reason for low risk groups like kids and young adults to be vaccinated. They were obviously banking on sterilising immunity, or at the very least partial immunity that is longer lasting than a few months.
134	Agreement	It's a press release from a vaccine manufacturer (which we allow, as per sidebar), so you're fine! :)
259	Agreement	Why publicly ask Pfizer to submit in the first place after a failed trial? That in itself caused a lot of unnecessary controversy, which can erode public trust.   Why isn't the FDA instead focused on expediting the EUA for covaxin given that one already has completed successful phase 2 AND 3 trial for pediatric use? Ocugen filed the EUA over three months ago now- why hasn't the FDA taken action on it?
579	Agreement	21 working age people not being hospitalized with Omicron is hardly evidence of this. Not that I disagree vaccines work, but this is quite a low effort contribution that really isn‚Äôt based on this paper and in fact the paper‚Äôs authors do not draw the conclusion that the lack of hospitalization was due to vaccination.
935	Agreement	Why do these papers keep talking about viral load and ignore the fact that the majority of viral load is dead, non-infectious virus. Every paper that actually cultured the virus reported that the amount of infectious virus is lower in vaccinated individuals. https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/p9j8rd/virological_characteristics_of_sarscov2_vaccine/ reported that vaccinated people need 10 times the viral load to culture the same amount of live virus than unvaccinated people.  Edit: typo
163	Agreement	Pretty clear that moving the muscle that was injected into is a good thing.
770	Agreement	Layman asking, if we've reached the point of OAS, does that basically mean we can't beat COVID with vaccines anymore?
318	Disagreement	This is against current advice which is not to do more than light exercise after a COVID or Influenza vaccination but rather to take it easy. Joggers, gym bunnies and swimmers are told to lay off for the next couple of days. Coincidentally, by later in the day many are already feeling the effects of their immune system kicking in. In the paper, if I understand it right, the first exercise bout is within 50 mins of the vaccination.
79	Agreement	Does/can this happen with other vaccinations as well? I know that it can happen as a complication of other viral infections.  I would guess it is like myocarditis, where the vaccine increases the risk over no exposure, but infection increases the risk more than vaccination.
834	Agreement	So this analysis was done with all vaccines as opposed to JnJ? If only a small minority of people took JnJ, the signals were heavily diluted by mRNA vaccines.
314	Disagreement	Their data/presentation suggests that myocarditis risk goes down with vaccine compared to historical rates.  But this is because it is comparing 30 day myoC risk for vaccines and infection, to 1 year historical.  The right comparison for unvax is chance of covid * extra risk of myoC.  In US, a 20% chance of having got/getting covid in general population means at least 20% chance for unvax to get it.  Even if the covid infection risk were 7% (or more), there would be higher total risk of myoC than vaccination.  But this is still not the right comparison.  If you get 1 vaccine shot per year, it would be compared to 7% chance of getting covid per year.  2 vaccine shots/year would compare to 14% chance of covid per year.  And yet, this is still not the right comparison because covid infection can lead to much more long term negatives, in addition to initial discomfort/death risk of covid.   The right comparison would be "shit that can happen weighted by severity of shit" as a result of vaccinated vs unvaxed... excluding accidents over 1 year.  There may still be reason to avoid 2 booster shots per year going forward.   This study doesn't give any info.
49	Agreement	At this point it's obvious that we need to change strategy. The 2019 sequence is not good enough.
218	Agreement	They did PCR on samples from the heart, but I didn't see any testing that would rule out prior history of covid infection?   (If you look at the CDC website, they can do PCR on blood samples to differentiate between a person who has had a covid infection and one who has been vaccinated. )
129	Agreement	It may not matter which lineage it comes from. If the saying, life finds a way, holds true, then it‚Äôs just a fruitless battle of trying to stave off non serious infections. Immune evasive is immune evasive and does not necessarily follow lineages in any relationship. So, if somewhere down the line, another omicron lineaged variant becomes immune evasive to all the previous variants and vaccines, then it will be, by it‚Äôs nature, different enough.  After all, omicron evolved in parallel to other variants and is closer in lineage to the ancestral strain, yet, more immune evasive than delta. Our vaccines were based on the ancestral strain yet they are more effective against delta than omicron.
306	Disagreement	Please excuse me for being lazy and not trying to find this in the study, but are these comparable groups? I would imagine so bc that seems like that‚Äôs the only fair comparison. Vaccination rates are much higher in older groups and those with more health conditions.
61	Agreement	Confidence interval is wide enough to drive a truck through.  Add in this is a test negative study with a high degree of seroprevalence in the control arm and a high rate of vaccination of the most vulnerable, and I think we should be careful in interpreting these results.
921	Agreement	We don‚Äôt have solid data on this yet. Patients require mechanical ventilation at lower rates with Omicron, so that might point towards your theory. I think we‚Äôll have to wait (or look harder) for a complete answer on this.
647	Agreement	Do you have a source on that $0.50 cost figure?
846	Agreement	Sure, and from this year, to boot:  https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2022/01/A-Literature-Review-and-Meta-Analysis-of-the-Effects-of-Lockdowns-on-COVID-19-Mortality.pdf  It's important to note that the studies you listed were published in May (1 month into lockdown in the USA), and November (7 months in) 2020.  The JHU study I just linked has nearly 2 years of lockdown data to draw from.
329	Disagreement	You should stop being so confidently wrong about things. Whatever Om specificity exists is extremely likely to be effective against sublineages of Om, which BA.2 is.      Also, they are taking a gamble, but an educated one, that Omicron will be the source for significant variants for at least a while if not through the next few waves. There is good logic to this gamble.
590	Neutral	Abstract  >Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a hyperinflammatory state that occurs after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We present 2 cases of MIS-C after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; 1 patient had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings suggest that vaccination modulates the pathogenesis of MIS-C.
692	Agreement	I didn't say that was great news.  I said that the reduced immune escape was. Obviously, greater inherent transmissibility is a problem. But we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Recognizing that A is good does not detract B being bad.
405	Agreement	There has been speculation that spaced boosters lead to antibodies that are much more resistant to mutation.
963	Agreement	Yup, vaccine vs covid is a false dichotomy. Since you will likely catch multiple breakthroughs and reinfections in the next several years.
665	Agreement	For males under 40, both Moderna ~~and Pfizer~~ 2nd/3rd dose causes significantly more myocarditis.  Vaccines are good when used in the right way for the right people. Encouraging fully vaxxed young men potentially with recent breakthroughs to get boosted could possibly do more harm than good. Mandating it for young men is even harder to justify in light of this new study.  Edit:  I misused the word "significantly". I was referring to the difference in point estimates, not statistical significance. There was no statistical significance for Pfizer.
537	Agreement	> better education ‚Ä¶ long-term risks  No.  There are people who argued back when we started vaccinating children that *mayyyybe* 3 deaths was somehow worse than hundreds of thousands of *for sure* deaths.  The trolley problem preempts any serious weighing of risk as a matter of public dialog.
229	Agreement	This study tested for neutralising antibodies in the blood which are quite specific.
462	Disagreement	It is. This sub is routinely brigaded by people who really want the vaccines to be dangerous to young males.
529	Neutral	*This study only looked at inactivated SARS279 CoV-2 vaccines, but in their discussion they cite a recent study which shows that the trend toward less NAb generation after each additional "booster" w/ mRNA 1273 seems to be in line w/ their results.  The mRNA vaccines don't include anything but the spike, so it's unknown if they'll also induce a shift in immune focus after multiple boosts.     ____      **Abstract**   A recent MMWR reported that the effectiveness of a 3rd dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine waned quickly in the Omicron-predominant period. Similarly, a substantial decline of immune responses induced by a 3rd dose of inactivated vaccines was also observed in our study. In response to the fast waning immune response and the great threat of Omicron variant of concern (VOC) to frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), **38 HCWs who were in our previous cohort investigating responses to the first three doses of inactivated vaccines participated in the current study and volunteered to receive a 4th homologous booster**. Here, we demonstrated that the 4th dose is safe and capable of recalling waned immune responses 6 months after the 3rd dose. However, a greater suppression on the induction of overall Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and NAbs targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) was found in participants with stronger immune responses after the 3rd dose. As a result, **a stepwise elevation of RBD-NAbs from the 1st to the 3rd vaccination achieved a "turning point". The peak RBD-NAbs level induced by the 4th dose was inferior to the peak of the 3rd dose. Accompanied with reduced induction of RBD-NAbs, the immune system shifted responses to the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein.** Although NTD directed antibodies are capable of neutralization, they only compensated the loss of RBD-NAbs to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus but not to the Omicron variant due to a substantial conformational change of Omicron NTD. This longitudinal clinical study monitored the immune response of the same cohort for every doses, shaping a relationship between the trajectory of immune focus and the dynamics of the neutralizing potency against the evolving virus. Our data reveal that immune responses could not be endlessly elevated, while suppression of heightened immune responses focusing on one subunit together with a shift of immune responses to other subunits would occur after repeated vaccination. Thus, an updated vaccine with more diverse epitopes capable of inducing NAbs against VOCs would be a future direction for boosters.
712	Agreement	I was interested in this part:  >The most common symptoms were muscle and joint pain, fatigue, and fever,  while the least common symptoms were loss of taste and smell. No one was admitted to the hospital.    >If we assume that the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was on the evening of the gathering, the incubation  period was short, ranging from 2 to 6 days, with a mean incubation period of 3.24 days (95% CI 2.87- 3.60). Time to resolution of symptoms varied, and at the end of follow-up, five individuals still reported  symptoms, while the rest reported symptoms lasting 1 to 9 days.  Median age was 45.
646	Agreement	Do they take into account that the vaccinated can still get covid and get another chance of GBS?
226	Agreement	This is what I‚Äôd really like to know.
558	Agreement	> Well, that particular vaccine doesn't introduce any spikes at all, it just instructs the body to produce them, unless I'm misunderstanding what you're saying.  Right, but so does the mRNA vaccine: it doesn't introduce any spikes, it just instructs the body to produce them. So the end result is essentially the same, you wind up with the protein spikes in your system.  >is the issue their mere presence in the lungs in the form of a dead/unable to reproduce spike, or that they're in the lungs multiplying in the form of actual COVID?  How much of a problem this is is open to debate, but from what I understand, the spikes actually can attach to your cells, and then just stay there until a T-cell comes along and takes care of it.  >I would assume that by having some of them there from an inhaled vaccine, but not multiplying, this would allow the body to address it very quickly and provide much needed local immunity at one of the sites where COVID really causes an issue.  Yeah but the main place where Covid really causes an issue is your lungs, and it seems very possible you could get at least some of the spikes in there if you inhaled the vaccine.  To be clear here I'm not theorizing there is a problem. I just want to hear the formal reasoning as to why it is *not* a problem. And if the spikes are really no problem at all, what was the rationale for making this an intramuscular injection in the first place?
831	Agreement	So my (admittedly limited) understanding is that it's used for surveillance. Meaning - we expect say 3,000 cases of myocarditis in males of a certain age group every year due to xyz things that we know cause myocarditis (aka 'background rate'). If VAERS pops up that we're suddenly seeing 4000 cases of myocarditis in males of a certain age group in a specific year that becomes significant because the number we're seeing reported is statistically higher than the 'background' cases expected.
695	Agreement	I have yet to see a study that shows long lasting protection in lab animals with t-cell only vaccines. Taking for granted that non tissue resident tcells will protect you from severe disease is dangerous. We have seen how much the protection from severe disease drops with the single doseJJ vaccine, a vaccine that produces a good t-cell response.
519	Neutral	**Abstract**  *Importance*  Identification of adverse events after vaccination increases awareness of vaccine-associated complications, leading to early diagnosis and treatment. Evidence remains scarce on the association between the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL).  *Objective*   To assess the association between the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and SSNHL.  *Design, Setting, and Participants*  This retrospective, population-based cohort study was performed from December 20, 2020, to May 31, 2021, using data from the largest health care organization in Israel. Patients 16 years or older who received the first vaccine dose between December 20, 2020, and April 30, 2021, and the second vaccine dose between January 10, 2021, and April 30, 2021, were included.  *Exposures*  Receipt of first and second BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses.  *Main Outcomes and Measures*  The main outcome was SSNHL based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes in conjunction with concurrent prednisone dispensing. Observed cases of SSNHL, occurring within 21 days after each of the first and second vaccine doses, were compared with the expected cases based on the experience of the population in 2018 and 2019. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and attributable risks were computed.  *Results*  Overall, 2‚ÄØ602‚ÄØ557 patients (mean \[SD\] age, 46.8 \[19.6\] years; 51.5% female) received the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, with 91 cases of SSNHL reported. Of these patients, 2‚ÄØ441‚ÄØ719 (93.8%) received the second vaccine dose, with 79 cases of SSNHL reported. The age- and sex-weighted SIRs were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.09-1.65) after the first vaccine dose and 1.23 (95% CI, 0.98-1.53) after the second vaccine dose. After the first vaccine dose, the estimated SIRs were more pronounced in female patients aged 16 to 44 years (SIR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.98-3.43) and female patients 65 years or older (SIR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.15-2.37). After the second vaccine dose, the highest estimated SIR was observed in male patients 16 to 44 years (SIR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.36-4.07). The attributable risks were generally small, and the results were similar when 2019 was used as a reference to estimate the expected number of SSNHL cases.  *Conclusions and Relevance*  This study suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine might be associated with increased risk of SSNHL; however, the effect size is very small. Further studies are warranted to establish this possible association.
722	Agreement	I‚Äôm always confused by this theory, why would the myocarditis risk be so specific to younger males if this was the case?
972	Disagreement	Comparing the rates of myocarditis from the vaccine vs from Covid is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. COVID has many ways to harm you with myocarditis being one of the lesser. A similar argument would be ‚Äúthe vaccine is dangerous because you‚Äôre more likely to get hurt via needle than if you contract Covid‚Äù. Like no shit Sherlock
165	Agreement	Probably pretty good, since EUA is really only available if there are no alternatives with full BLA. With both Pfizer and Moderna approved that's a harder argument to make now.
737	Agreement	In this case a lower odds ratio is better.  An odds ratio of 1 would mean the vaccine had absolutely zero effect. The lower the odds ratio, the more impact the vaccine had.
37	Neutral	Among the 100 patients with solid cancer, after two vaccine doses, nAbT against omicron was detectable in 37 (37%) patients (appendix p 4), whereas nAbT against delta was detectable in 56 (56%) patients (McNemar test, p=0¬∑0002) and nAbT against WT SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in 97 (97%) patients (p<0¬∑0001).2 **Among the 115 patients with solid cancer who had a third vaccine dose, nAbT against omicron was detectable in 104 (90%) patients,** whereas nAbT against delta was detectable in 112 (97%) patients (p=0¬∑013), and nAbT against WT SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in 114 (99%) patients (p=0¬∑0044).2     Among 79 patients with blood cancer, after two vaccine doses, nAbT against omicron was detectable in 15 (19%) patients (appendix p 4), whereas nAbT against delta was detetable in 31 (39%) patients (McNemar test, p=0¬∑0002) and nAbs against WT SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in 31 (89%) patients (p<0.0001). **Among the 84 patients who received a third vaccine dose, nAbs against omicron was detectable in 47 (56%) patientspatients**, whereas nAbT against delta was detectable in 60 (71%) patients (p=0.0009), and nAbT against WT SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in 72 (86%) patients (p<0¬∑0001). Considering the 64 of 79 patients with blood cancer who had undetectable nAbT against omicron after two vaccine doses, 29 (45%) developed nAbs against omicron after the third dose, indicating effective boosting in many patients. The nAbT against omicron correlated with nAbT against WT SARS-CoV-2 and delta, respectively (appendix p 4) but were consistently lower.
150	Agreement	Nothing new really, no published efficacy data on Delta or Omicron so far
407	Agreement	This is the right decision, but why did we get to this point in the first place?  We already knew they didn't have data showing that it's effective for 3-4 year olds and needed data on shot 3, so why were they asked to submit anyway?
19	Agreement	> The study finds no evidence of Omicron having lower severity than Delta  3 days ago in this very sub a study was published saying omicron infections were in fact much more mild than delta   https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/rgylbk/hkumed_finds_omicron_sarscov2_can_infect_faster/  now this study says the opposite. So...I don't know. Wait and see I guess. However, hospitalization rates in S Africa would in fact suggest ommicron is more mild.
231	Agreement	This was in the report.  Lots of claims of under reporting. But the under reporting isn't strongly related to adverse effects of vaccines.   "A comparison with national mortality data suggests that certain causes of death, such as accidents, suicides, or cancer, are less likely to be reported to VAERS. Underreporting to VAERS, in general, is expected"
22	Agreement	> We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of Omicron having different severity from Delta, **though data on hospitalisations are still very limited**.   Isn't hospitalization rates a large part of how severity is measured though? Seems very premature to make this pronouncement with such limited data
443	Disagreement	Do we know what Pfizer‚Äôs numbers were, or just that 6 month to 2 years met whatever their endpoint was, but 2-5 didn‚Äôt?
621	Agreement	Anyone manage to interpret what "vaccinated group" the efficacy of boosters was compared to?   Is it all of the vaccinated people in the study, or people at a similar time out from their 2nd dose (the hugely negative VE group)?
985	Disagreement	It doesn't.  They reported 100% efficacy against severe disease.  They reported 75% efficacy against someone getting moderate or severe disease.
523	Neutral	**Abstract**   ____   **Importance:** Although COVID-19 vaccines protect against infection and severe disease, the role of vaccination in preventing prolonged symptoms in those with subsequent infection is unclear.      **Objective:** To determine differences in symptoms stratified by prior vaccination reported by healthcare personnel (HCP) 6 weeks after onset of COVID-19, and whether there were differences in timing of return to work.      **Design:**  Nested cohort study within a multicenter vaccine effectiveness study. HCP with COVID-19 between December 2020 and August 2021 were followed up 6 weeks after illness onset. Setting: Health systems in 12 U.S. states.      **Participants:** HCP participating in a vaccine effectiveness study were eligible for inclusion if they had confirmed COVID-19 with either verified mRNA vaccination (symptom onset ‚â•14 days after two doses) or no prior COVID-19 vaccination. Among 681 eligible participants, 419 (61%) completed a follow-up survey approximately 6 weeks after illness onset. Exposures: Two doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine compared with no COVID-19 vaccine. Main outcomes and measures: Presence of symptoms 6 weeks after onset of COVID-19 illness and days to return to work after COVID-19 illness.      **Results:** Among 419 HCP with confirmed COVID-19, 298 (71%) reported one or more COVID-like symptoms 6 weeks after illness onset, with a lower prevalence among vaccinated participants (60.6%) compared with unvaccinated participants (60.6% vs. 79.1%; aRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58-0.84). Vaccinated HCP returned to work a median 2.0 days (95% CI 1.0-3.0) sooner than unvaccinated HCP (aHR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04-1.79).      **Conclusions:** A history of two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine among HCP with COVID-19 illness was associated with decreased risk of COVID-like symptoms at 6 weeks and earlier to return to work. Vaccination is associated with improved recovery from COVID-19, in addition to preventing symptomatic infection.
748	Agreement	Is this saying that the vaccine causes brain cancer? Also, OP looks like a bot by post history. Also, in vitro doesn't mean in vivo and that doesn't account for spread and the blood brain barrier.
260	Agreement	Woah very interesting about the flu vaccine reducing heart attacks. Are you able to direct me to somewhere I could read more about that? Very cool
112	Agreement	I‚Äôm in Ontario Canada where we had to space out shots due to availability, 2 shots and today we‚Äôre [-91.8%](https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/ontario-dashboard/) reduction for ICU occupancy per million compared to unvaccinated.
265	Agreement	Yeah they had to completely redo their phase 2 trial after the original design wasn't immunogenic enough. No doubt they'd have been a major player if they'd nailed it first time.
193	Agreement	That's because this was only 24 hospitalized Omicron patients.   No evidence means that they can't make any statement on it.  It doesnt mean that the evidence suggests it is just as severe.  The statement probably should have been left out of the article because it doesn't add anything to the analysis.
432	Disagreement	1) the study they cite as demonstrating integration of the viral genome into cells has been widely panned as artifact.  It was published in PNAS by bypassing peer review.  2) They basically forced reverse transcription to happen and then reported that it happened.  This article is basically published misinformation.  EDIT: a friend of mine already did a very nice takedown of this on his blog.  But I can‚Äôt post it here because of the auto mod.  But if you follow Edward Nirenberg‚Äôs blog, deplatformdisease, you‚Äôll find it there.
352	Agreement	Booster uptake has been really high in very vulnerable populations. If there was a much better booster at preventing hospitalizations, it would be amazing. In my province (Quebec), 33% of new COVID-related hospitalizations in the last 28 days were in people who had received 3 doses. Maybe this is a population for which severe immune problems prevent the vaccines from protecting them efficiently.
396	Agreement	Sorry to bother you, i don't have much knowledge on how they did this experiment, but I still have a few questions - if what they said on the study is indeed correct, wouldn't they need to do experiments on people to actually prove what they are saying? Also if the worst case scenario is indeed true, what should we do? Also pardon my english this is the first time in 6 months I'm having a conversation with anyone in the internet.
320	Disagreement	This is just old data and comparing all age groups against mRNA on specific age group. Not a good design at all.  If you want to see a more accurate picture, look towards Denmark or Norway where they have excellent data tracking. One such example is here: https://www.fhi.no/nyheter/2021/myokarditt-etter-koronavaksinasjon-i-norge/
25	Agreement	>I'm surprised that I am not reading anything on what happened to SARS? Why did it change from a very efficient killing machine to essentially disappearing as an extant threat? Why is MERS not able to make that transition from what it is to something like Covid? Heck, what happened to syphilis to turn it from what it was to the sexually transmitted slow motion killer it is now days? I can't find those journal articles...  Syphilis is (currently...) controlled by antibiotics (and fear of HIV) and SARS-1 was killed off by aggressive public health containment measures.  MERS is a zoonotic virus (camels) that doesn't spread well in humans because it tends to put them in ICU. It's in the same category as avian influenza.
117	Agreement	In the USA, the Pfizer vaccine is the only one approved (through use of an EUA) for adolescents and children (down to age 5).  The only non mRNA vaccine in the USA is the J&J and the production of this has been discontinued (and not approved for those under 18).  I see this relevant to the study as it is using the VAERS reports which is the reporting system used by the US CDC.
486	Disagreement	These aren't human trials.
509	Agreement	"a counterintuitive result of our analysis is that the highest risk of resistant strain establishment occurs when a large fraction of the population has already been vaccinated but the transmission is not controlled. "  We've seen that lockdown measures resulted in practically no benefit (in fact, arguably are detrimental overall), in other research on this subreddit.  The implication here is that the hypothesis, that we should only vaccinate the at-risk during the pandemic, intentionally to avoid producing new strains before the disease becomes endemic, is correct.  Selection pressure in action.
330	Agreement	> : the unvaccinated cohort would‚Äôve surely been more likely to have had a recent prior infection than the vaccinated cohort (due to the protective effect of vaccination in previous months).  You know that was my thought too, maybe for example a previous spike provided natural immunity for a bit. But then I would expect the graph to have a positive spike correlating to the non-infections of the vaccinated vs the unvaccinated during that spike? Or is that corrected for? The slope of the line seems pretty steady.
892	Agreement	They mention GSK pandemic adjuvant. Does anybody know if this is the same adjuvant used in the Sanofi-GSK protein subunit vaccine that a press release was made about yesterday?
466	Disagreement	My completely unfounded hypothesis is that the Delta mutation didn't actually affect the S protein's morphologic shape too much. It seems that Delta's increased infectionsness was mostly based on increased furin cleavage before expulsion of an infected cell. ( https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02275-2 ).  Omicron does seem very different, especially S-protein-wise, so a new custom-tailored vaccine with it's own antibody and mRNA sequence would seem more promising.
302	Disagreement	Nice study, but a major limitation is that it did not control at all for possible confounding factors:  >Vaccine hesitancy in Hong Kong is highest among the elderly and in individuals with underlying health conditions.^(36) In this scenario so-called ‚Äòhealthy vaccinee bias‚Äô, by which vaccine recipients are healthier than their unvaccinated peers, may inflate the estimates.^(35) Although we have accounted for age in the current estimates, a lack of individual-level data on controls mean that this cannot be formally assessed with currently available data.
920	Agreement	We do expect booster VE to diminish over time, particularly against symptomatic disease/infection, and we would expect the same if we were using an omicron specific booster as well, though it might take longer. A booster of the original formula provides better VE because it elicits more antibodies than even the peak amount from two doses, and there is increasing evidence that these elicited antibodies are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù (higher quality, more breadth, more avidity) and that the booster helps B cells to continue making them better over time as well so that they can better address new variants like omicron. So, even once the antibodies have waned (as is expected), the immune system can jump into gear with the better antibodies and clear the infection quickly and efficiently.   As far as a 10 month Pfizer trial data, I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre referring to.
664	Agreement	Finally some actual qualitative analysis! Some of these studies have been maddeningly binary (i.e., if you have occasional headaches a month after a 'breakthrough' infection, congratulations you have long covid, at least according to some of the studies).  &#x200B;      Long COVID symptoms were less severe in vaccinated compared with     unvaccinated participants 120 days after recruitment (mean difference in COVID     ST score = -1.8, 95% CI: -2.5 to -1.0), and more vaccinated than unvaccinated     participants had remission of all long COVID symptoms (16.6% versus 7.5%, HR     = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.23 to 3.15)     ‚Ä¢ The impact of long COVID on the lives of vaccinated participants was also less than     unvaccinated participants (mean difference in COVID impact score = -3.3, 95% CI:     -6.2 to -0.5), and fewer vaccinated participants found their symptoms unacceptable     (38.9% versus 46.4%, risk difference = -7.5%, 95% CI: -14.4% to -0.5%)  I think many people are really waiting with baited breath about the risks of long covid for vaccinated individuals.  Most aren't really worried about dying or winding up in the hospital anymore, but with a lot of aspects of 'normal' life returning, we really ought to be able to say with confidence, in plain terms what the risks *actually* are for the vaxxed and boosted. I think it would go a long way to be able to say, "significant long term impacts from covid in vaccinated individuals are rare, x out of 100 people, and even less in people in good health".
280	Disagreement	>If the saying, life finds a way, holds true,  It is not true. 99.999999% of all species that ever emerged went extinct. Life is a fleeting miracle.   Viruses are not life. They are proto-life, a simple code written in a language that our bodies understand. We can stomp it down with masks, distance, handwashing and vaccines. We can make it extinct if we chose. Like Australia and New Zealand did, even as we kept reinfecting them.
673	Agreement	Good to keep in mind booster is more recent than 2 doses.  For what it matters Israel is going for 4th dose for 60+ and healthcare workers indicating they are not seeing great efficacy of 3rd dose after a while.  Feels similar to fighting the influenza with last season's vaccine.
862	Agreement	The danish study does this well. See table 2 in this preprint. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.27.21268278v1.full-text  The gist is this: ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù people were about as likely as unvaccinated people to become infected (1.04x) with omicron, while boosted people were about half as likely as the fully vaccinated to become infected (0.54x).  A more recent study out of Ontario came to similar conclusions about ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù being essentially ineffective at preventing infection. They were slightly more pessimistic about the booster group, suggesting effectiveness at preventing infection was 37%. You can find that study here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268565v1  Again, this is about infection, not serious illness.
950	Agreement	Yeah this is a strange one‚Ä¶and frankly, do we care if they don‚Äôt work independently against a designed antigen? I guess there‚Äôs always something to learn, but this almost feels like just seeing if we can trick the immune system if we try hard enough.
800	Agreement	On the other hand, it may be a good first course for those not yet vaccinated or previously exposed.
164	Agreement	Pretty sure that was a target, not a requirement. And it was to be measured against prevention of moderate to severe disease, or at least symptomatic infection.
172	Neutral	Self-selection bias: People who (from experience) suffers more during influenza epidemics are more likely to get the vaccine than people who have rarely if ever been sick from flu.
72	Agreement	Does anyone know what happened to the **Delta-specific** booster research? I thought Pfizer was going to release the early data on that in Dec 2021.
298	Disagreement	Is that true in Sweden? It is my understanding they never really had a vaccine passport system.
851	Agreement	Thanks so much! That‚Äôs a great explanation that makes sense.
190	Agreement	thanks...I missed that...and yes anyone with typical covid symptoms would be classified as Covid-like illness until a positive test confirms it is COVID-19
640	Agreement	Completely agree
113	Agreement	If I read the study properly, their vaccinated group was negative for CV antibodies and/or was not known to have a confirmed case of CV19.
847	Agreement	Sure, but for how long? Social distancing and masks can't go on for years. Those should end as soon as the healthcare systems are at no risk of being overwhelmed anymore.
256	Agreement	Where does it say hospitalized? In the notes they said the data was pulled from both hospitals and clinics.
288	Disagreement	I feel like this study was set up poorly‚Ä¶. And the summary leaves out a lot of important data/assumptions:  1. [Figure 1](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-022-06629-2/MediaObjects/41598_2022_6629_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp) clearly shows the time between sampling is grossly disproportionate. Vaccinated samples taken anywhere between 10-50 days post 2nd dose. While convalescent samples averaged ~210 days post symptom onset‚Ä¶   2. Gross age difference, knowing younger people produce a stronger immune response: ‚ÄúThere were differences in age and in sampling time between the convalescent and immunized groups. The immunized group had a median age of 35.5 years which was different from that of the convalescent group at 59.0‚Äù  3. ‚ÄúThere was a difference in the antibody levels from samples taken within 2 months and at 6 months post second dose where the 6 months antibody levels were sharply lower‚Äù  4. ‚ÄúIn contrast, convalescent sera did not exhibit a correlative between time and antibody levels, with a median follow-up time of 207 days from the disease onset.‚Äù
774	Agreement	Maybe not from this study alone but aren‚Äôt we close to consensus on this by now - omicron largely evades antibodies from prior infection/vaccination, but is neutralized by broader b and t cell response?  So, vaccines will not protect well from omicron infection, but will protect well from severity. The one unknown is how severe omicron is in those with zero prior covid-19 immunity.
773	Agreement	Looks like more studies underway;  >Research in progress  >Four additional studies were identified that are still in progress:  >‚Ä¢ An NIHR funded study by Prieto-Alhambra et al will examine the effect of different COVID-19 vaccines on long COVID in the UK (23).  >‚Ä¢ A study by Massey et al (Project COVID Recovery: Vaccination Study) will measure the changes in participants‚Äô moderate to severe PASC symptoms at 6, 12 and 15 weeks after vaccination in the US (24).  >‚Ä¢ A study by Premkumar et al (EvaLongCovid, NCT05107271) will measure long haul COVID-19 related symptoms in adults with chronic liver disease in India (25).  >‚Ä¢ A randomised controlled trial by the √Årea de Ensayos Cl√≠nicos (EUCTR2021-003331-28- ES) will randomise adults with COVID symptoms persisting 3 weeks after the acute phase of COVID-19 in Spain to either the Pfizer vaccine or placebo, and measure the change in frequency and intensity of symptoms (26).
15	Agreement	> Not other relevant end points like **long covid**, hospitalization and death, which 2 shots still show protection against.  Given that you‚Äôve said this twice in this thread I‚Äôd like to see a citation with regards to long COVID. I linked [this paper](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1062160/v1) and I would say Figure 4 shows there isn‚Äôt really much protection there. The biggest numbers I have seen from other studies aren‚Äôt even 50% and a few studies have found no significant effect... It‚Äôs not promising on the long COVID front but I‚Äôd be happy to be proven wrong.  With regards to hospitalization and death I agree. Two doses seems to still show strong protection and that‚Äôs a good thing.
464	Disagreement	It‚Äôa not patent free but free to license. However producing that drug takes too long. I think Pfizer said it takes 8 months for 1 batch.
18	Agreement	> That doesn‚Äôt matter if you randomize correctly. The effect of previous infections will be similar in both cohorts.  Okay well they‚Äôre not randomizing, because the cohorts are:  > - Cohort #1 (n = 615): Received two doses of the current Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 90-180 days prior to enrollment; in the study, participants will receive one or two doses of the Omicron-based vaccine  > - Cohort #2 (n = 600): Received three doses of the current Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 90-180 days prior to enrollment; in the study, participants will receive one dose of the current Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or the Omicron-based vaccine  > - Cohort #3 (n=205): Vaccine-na√Øve participants will receive three doses of the Omicron-based vaccine  Pleeeease read things before you comment especially in a science sub. Since you said ‚Äúboth cohorts‚Äù and there are three it‚Äôs clear you didn‚Äôt read the contents. This isn‚Äôt randomized at all.
86	Agreement	Great, now the CDC need to wake up and use the same guidance that europe does for JnJ do they too can get a third dose.
73	Agreement	Does anyone know where Novavax is on trials for < 5 year olds? That is the big gap in the US right now.
690	Agreement	I can't download the study for some reason but I don't understand this question. Isn't this looking at covid patients and comparing the risk of covid-induced GBS between vaccinated vs unvaccinated? The overview doesn't seem like it is actually looking at the risk of GBS from the vaccine. Otherwise they would have had to select that group before they got vaccinated.
34	Agreement	Alright, what's the protection against severe and critical cases for 2 doses with Omicron compared to 3 doses with Omicron?
994	Disagreement	The study has a low number of samples n=8 if i am not mistaken. Does this study have any statistical value?
