565	Agreement	>GAITHERSBURG, Md., Feb. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a biotechnology company dedicated to developing and commercializing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced that NVX-CoV2373, its recombinant nanoparticle protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, achieved its primary effectiveness endpoint in the pediatric expansion of its PREVENT-19 pivotal Phase 3 trial and demonstrated 80% efficacy overall at a time when the Delta variant was the predominant circulating strain in the U.S. The study enrolled 2,247 adolescents aged 12 through 17-years across 73 sites in the U.S. to evaluate safety, effectiveness (immunogenicity), and efficacy, with an emphasis on ensuring well balanced racial and ethnic representation among participants.  >"We are encouraged by the results in this adolescent population given the ongoing need for alternative vaccine options for COVID-19," said Filip Dubovsky, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Novavax. "We believe the Novavax vaccine offers a differentiated technology and option for this younger population given its established protein-based technology already used in other vaccines, and the positive responses demonstrated against variants."  >The primary PREVENT-19 pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted in adults aged 18 years and older, results of which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), enrolled approximately 30,000 participants in the U.S. and Mexico. NVX-CoV2373 achieved 90.4% efficacy overall and demonstrated a reassuring safety and tolerability profile. Serious and severe adverse events in adults were low in number and balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. The most common adverse reactions observed in adults during clinical studies (frequency category of very common ‚â•1/10) were headache, nausea or vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, injection site tenderness/pain, fatigue, and malaise. Novavax will continue to collect and analyze real-world data, for both the primary PREVENT-19 trial and the pediatric expansion, including the monitoring of safety and the evaluation of variants, as the vaccine is distributed.  >NVX-CoV2373 has not yet been authorized in the adolescent population. Novavax expects to submit its regulatory filings for a pediatric indication in adolescents aged 12 through 17-years to global regulatory authorities during the first quarter of 2022. Novavax also expects to initiate additional studies globally evaluating younger age groups during the second quarter of 2022.  >To date, NVX-CoV2373 has received authorization from multiple regulatory authorities globally, including conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and emergency use listing (EUL) from the World Health Organization (WHO). With WHO EUL, there is the opportunity for authorization in over 170 countries with a potential reach of over six billion lives. The vaccine is also currently under review by multiple regulatory agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  >Results: Clinical efficacy consistent between adolescent and adult participants  >In the placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study, adolescent participants were randomized 2:1 to receive active vaccine or placebo. Study participants underwent blinded crossover to alternate study material after the required safety data were collected to ensure that all participants received active vaccine. During the period of placebo-controlled observation, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated overall protective efficacy of 79.5% (95% CI: 46.8, 92.1) against COVID-19. Efficacy was consistent across age groups and all cases observed in the vaccine group were mild as defined by the trial protocol.  >Efficacy endpoints were accrued from May 24 through September 27, 2021 ‚Äì a time when the Delta variant was the predominant strain in the U.S., showing high transmission and high severity of disease. Sequence data are available for 11 of the 20 confirmed cases, 100% of which were determined to be caused by the Delta variant. Vaccine efficacy against the Delta variant was 82.0% (95% CI: 32.4, 95.2).  >Results: Consistent response to variants  >Data from the pediatric expansion of PREVENT-19 showed in post hoc analyses robust immune responses in adolescents, including IgG responses against Spike proteins of several variants (including Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Mu, and Omicron) that were 2-3-fold higher than in adults, with 100% seroconversion against all variants following a 2-dose series of vaccinations. Adolescent functional immune responses (hACE2 receptor inhibition) against these variants were 2.4-4-fold higher than in adults against all evaluated variants.  >Results: A reassuring safety and reactogenicity profile  >Preliminary safety data from the pediatric expansion of PREVENT-19 showed the vaccine to be generally well-tolerated. Serious and severe adverse events were low in number and balanced between vaccine and placebo groups, and not considered related to the vaccine. Local and systemic reactogenicity was generally lower than or similar to adults, after the first and second dose. The most common adverse reactions observed were injection site tenderness/pain, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and malaise. There was no increase in reactogenicity in younger (12 to <15 years old) adolescents compared to older (15 to <18 years old) adolescents. No safety signal was observed through the placebo-controlled portion of the study.  >Study Endpoints  >The pediatric expansion of PREVENT-19 achieved its primary effectiveness (immunogenicity) endpoint, with neutralizing antibody responses non-inferior to those observed in young-adult (18 to 26 years old) participants from PREVENT-19. Adolescent neutralizing antibody responses using wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were approximately 1.5-fold higher in adolescents than in young adults, meeting FDA-specified criteria.
94	Agreement	how much is the Moderna  booster helping and also how long after the booster is it effective ?
186	Agreement	Thanks for sharing this. Several of those studies (preprints all of them) actually did see a small improvement with B.1 customized vaccines, however the effect size wasn't tremendous. To me results really just beg the question rather than answer it. The virus is rapidly evolving and we know for a fact that the original vaccines preformed less effectively against omicron (in humans)--to me that is proof enough that we need to pre-emptively update the vaccine in anticipation of the next wave
599	Neutral	Abstract   Multiple COVID-19 vaccines, representing diverse vaccine platforms, successfully protect against symptomatic COVID-19 cases and deaths. Head-to-head comparisons of T cell, B cell, and antibody responses to diverse vaccines in humans are likely to be informative for understanding protective immunity against COVID-19, with particular interest in immune memory. Here, SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific immune responses to Moderna mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 were examined longitudinally for 6 months. 100% of individuals made memory CD4+ T cells, with cTfh and CD4-CTL highly represented after mRNA or NVX-CoV2373 vaccination. mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S induced comparable CD8+ T cell frequencies, though memory CD8+ T cells were only detectable in 60-67% of subjects at 6 months. Ad26.COV2.S was not the strongest immunogen by any measurement, though the Ad26.COV2.S T cell, B cell, and antibody responses were relatively stable over 6 months. A differentiating feature of Ad26.COV2.S immunization was a high frequency of CXCR3+ memory B cells. mRNA vaccinees had substantial declines in neutralizing antibodies, while memory T cells and B cells were comparatively stable over 6 months. These results of these detailed immunological evaluations may also be relevant for vaccine design insights against other pathogens.
564	Agreement	>For the mRNA vaccines, a big point of concern with some has been the introduction of those proteins spikes into the body, which they see as potentially harmful  Well, that particular vaccine doesn't introduce any spikes at all, it just instructs the body to produce them, unless I'm misunderstanding what you're saying.   >But if this is inhaled, isn‚Äôt there a good chance that at least some of those adenoviruses are going to wind up in the lungs and produce spikes there?  is the issue their mere presence in the lungs in the form of a dead/unable to reproduce spike, or that they're in the lungs multiplying in the form of actual COVID?   I would assume that by having some of them there from an inhaled vaccine, but not multiplying, this would allow the body to address it very quickly and provide much needed local immunity at one of the sites where COVID really causes an issue. The same immunity we will get at the mucosal level in the airway entry points.
182	Agreement	Spike get‚Äôs lower but it‚Äôs not going to be 0. In US there are no inactive vaccines. So if they do an antibody test against N protein it should return 0.0 au/ml incase of no prior infection.
651	Agreement	Does 150+ days look positive at all?
236	Agreement	Totally possible that this is ALSO true. Exercising might increase antibody response, and ALSO increase myocarditis risk.   Findings like this aren't immediately grouped as "good" or "bad". They just "are".   Also, walking for 90 minutes qualifies as "exercise" from what I'm reading, which probably won't result in myocarditis. They're not saying you need to do an intense workout.
29	Agreement	1. A better antibody match should/could lead to an initially higher and more durable protection against infection.   I also wonder if there‚Äôs any hypothesizing that priming the immune system with the original wuhan spike and then subsequently showing it the near-worst-case-scenario mutated omicron spike might make it really go into ‚Äúhyperdrive‚Äù as far as quantity, breadth, and avidity of response, and perhaps leave it very well equipped, at least for a while, to address future branches from either end of the spectrum, as well as variants that arise in between. There‚Äôs always going to be antibody waning, but with a good match and B cells highly trained to handle whatever variant spike they see, that could put us in a better place.  2. My understanding is that, based on fda guidance from last year, ‚Äútrials‚Äù for variant specific vaccines should be akin to yearly flu shot trials, focusing largely on safety and demonstrating an immune response in vitro. They‚Äôve been saying all along that deployment could be somewhere around March on the optimistic side, and they also say that they‚Äôre already manufacturing doses of this at risk, so I have to assume that at least from Pfizer‚Äôs end, March is still very much on the table, if it‚Äôs shown to be safe and stimulate a sufficient immune response. The ball will obviously ultimately be in fda (and subsequently cdc)‚Äôs court, but I take this announcement to mean that they‚Äôre on track.
615	Agreement	An open letter by a group of public health experts, clinicians, scientists  SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 278 million people globally, with at least 5.4 million deaths recorded by the World Health Organisation as of 26 December 2021. The omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of concern is spreading rapidly.  Some countries view infection as a net harm and pursue strategies ranging from suppression to elimination. They seek to sustain low infection rates through a combination of vaccination, public health measures, and financial support measures (vaccines-plus). Other countries implemented mitigation strategies that aim to prevent health systems from being overwhelmed by building population immunity through a combination of infection and vaccination. These countries rely on a vaccines-only approach and seem willing to tolerate high levels of infection provided their healthcare systems can cope.  The high transmissibility and degree of immune escape by the delta and omicron variants means sustained protective population immunity is unlikely to be achieved with the current vaccines based on the original strain. Compared to delta, omicron is much more likely to infect those who were vaccinated or exposed to previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, suggesting significant immune escape.  Widespread transmission brings a degree of unpredictability to the pandemic response. High transmission risks more rapid adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, with outcomes that include increased transmissibility (seen with Œ±, delta, and omicron), increased antibody immune escape (Œ≤ and omicron) or greater pathogenicity (delta and Œ±).  There are other drawbacks to a vaccines-only strategy. Countries which tolerated high transmission have seen rises in both covid-specific and all-cause mortality, healthcare worker shortages, and repeated lockdowns to control surges in case numbers. Countries which suppressed transmission early saw reduced mortality and less economic damage.  While vaccination greatly reduces risks of serious illness and death, long covid remains a concern. Disruption to education as a result of staff and student sickness, and/or repeated lockdowns due to failure to control the virus, are likely to have a lasting impact on the wellbeing and prospects of the next generation.  High levels of transmission also create a negative feedback loop, whereby important public health measures such as test, trace, isolate and support systems become overwhelmed, making them less effective, further fuelling transmission.  For all these reasons, a vaccines-plus approach should be adopted globally. This strategy will slow the emergence of new variants and ensure they exist in a low transmission background where they can be controlled by effective public health measures, while allowing everyone (including those clinically vulnerable) to go about their lives more freely.  We welcome the World Health Organisation‚Äôs recent guidance on community and healthcare mask use, but believe more can be done to suppress transmission without adversely impacting economic or social activity. Accordingly, we call upon the World Health Organisation and national governments to:  Unequivocally declare SARS-CoV-2 an airborne pathogen and stress the implications for preventing transmission. A clear message from the World Health Organisation will help to remove confusion that has been used to justify outdated policies.  Promote the use of high-quality face masks for indoor gatherings and other high-transmission settings. The significant benefits of community masking are now well established. Respirators (e.g. N95, P2/FFP2 or KF94) should be preferred in all indoor settings where people mix, and for healthcare workers at all times.  Advise on effective ventilation and filtration of air. It is time to go beyond opening windows and aim for a paradigm shift to ensure all public buildings are optimally designed, built, adapted, and utilised to maximise clean air for occupants‚Äîstrategies which have been shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  Set criteria for imposing or relaxing measures to reduce covid-19 spread based on levels of transmission in the community. Effective find, test, trace, isolate, and support will continue to be essential to intercept transmission. Low rates of transmission give all available measures the best chance of being effective, creating a positive, self-reinforcing cycle of disease control. Sufficient financial and practical support for isolation should be implemented everywhere, particularly in low- and middle-income countries and deprived parts of high-income countries.  Support urgent measures to achieve global vaccine equity, including vaccine sharing, suspension of vaccine patents, removal of barriers to technology transfer, and establish regional production centres to create a plentiful local supply of high-quality vaccines everywhere. Global vaccine rollout should include coordinated efforts to tackle misinformation to ensure people have access to timely, accurate data on vaccine effectiveness and protection.  Vaccines-plus is affordable and achievable. It is the policy advocated by the Director General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in his statement of 14 December 2021: ‚ÄúI need to be very clear: vaccines alone will not get any country out of this crisis. Countries can and must prevent the spread of Omicron with measures that work today. It‚Äôs not vaccines instead of masks, it‚Äôs not vaccines instead of distancing, it‚Äôs not vaccines instead of ventilation or hand hygiene. Do it all. Do it consistently. Do it well.‚Äù
470	Disagreement	Oh that's a good one. I am not an expert but I think flu vaccine selection mostly depends on which of multiple, co-circulating variants is dominant in a given year. While there was some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could end up resulting in regionalization and speciation [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2104241118](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2104241118) and this could still end up happening, right now there is just one dominant strain at a time.  As long as there is only one strain, I'd say we already have enough empirical information for vaccine prediction (but we can't predict what new mutations will emerge in the future so it's far from perfect). If we end up with multiple sub-types, then I'm not sure, but I'd hazard to guess it would be possible to do "in real time" given the crazy explosion in sequencing efforts.
340	Agreement	67% effectiveness is low? I mean yeah, it‚Äôs not 95%, but it‚Äôs pretty good in my book when a month or two ago nobody was sure if it would provide anything.
628	Agreement	BA.2--as expected--with less immune escape than BA.1. That's great news, considering it's coming up from behind.   It also is an indication to me that BA.1's transmission advantage is not so much about its inherent transmissibility as it is about immune escape.
806	Agreement	PCR done days before an event is a shitty way to detect infectivity on the day of a party. Take home antigen(thanks for correction) tests an hour before to catch people during infectious window would have been more likely to catch this. Michael Mina stuff.  Was this one person infecting all 21? Hopefully they did some sequencing so we can determine something about transmission dynamics. Are there any studies regarding why some people are so much more infectious than others? Is it greater expulsion of viral spittle or is it behavioral?  Edit: aaannnnd post locked. GJ mods. As a response to the below question regarding Antigen test sensitivity, the sensitivity is low relative to PCR. However we don't care about sensitivity relative to some absurdly high cycle threshold on PCR machines because it does not correlate to infectiousness. We care about sensitivity when you have one person producing enough infectious droplets to infect 21 other people. This presumably is what antigen tests are good at.  Consider that we've found that SARS-CoV-2 variants have had a low dispersion parameter k meaning that there's a smaller proportion of the population who are more likely to do the majority of the spreading. Antigen tests are to catch people who are high likelihood spreaders. We drive down R by testing everyone before they get together. Stuff that has been discussed since mid-2020.
639	Agreement	Can't calculate vaccine efficacy with this data.
554	Agreement	> That's great news    I don't think greater inherent transmissibility is great news.
552	Agreement	> showed a higher neutralization capacity against all 140 SARS-CoV-2 VoCs compared to infection-naive individuals, even afte  I haven't followed the literature extremely closely so I've only seen 3 prior papers that evaluated the relative effectiveness of infection recovery and vaccine and they were all consistent with the findings of this one. 2 papers were based on Israel data. Another recent paper was based on US data during Delta surge period. There was some variation in statistical significance but none of them showed vaccination alone to provide better protection than recovered infection.   I can't locate the Israel papers but here's the US paper: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm?s_cid=mm7104e1_w
2	Neutral	‚ÄúOn December 17, 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the companies would test a third 3 ¬µg dose given at least two months after the second dose in children under age 5 and a third dose of the 10 ¬µg formulation in children 5 to under 12 years of age.‚Äù
355	Agreement	Currently in S Africa cases are sky rocketing, meanwhile deaths are flat. Make of that data what you will.
897	Agreement	This is a poorly written preprint reporting results obtained in completely artificial conditions. Nothing interesting to learn here.
366	Agreement	Hopefully it'll help against severe disease
497	Disagreement	We need a nasal vaccine that elicits better mucosal immunity. That's why Omicron is causing so many breakthroughs. I don't think there's enough focus on getting at least 1 nasal vaccine tested/approved in spite of positive pre-prints on the potential efficacy.
424	Agreement	Yeah I‚Äôm thinking this is bc of omicron. Although 12-15 looks better. Lower dose issues? I wonder how it compares to Moderna‚Äôs trial.  5-11 is also the age of the lowest risk all around so perhaps it‚Äôs also something specific to the immune system of this age.
517	Agreement	[This study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422000769) has (pre-Omicron) Mongolian data on several vaccines, including Sputnik, which appears to perform between Sinopharm and AZ (and well below MRNA). A recent [Hungarian preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.18.22271179v1) shows similar results as well.
857	Agreement	That‚Äôs a shame. I guess the wild type is still the way to go because no matter how much these variants diverge the WT is the one variant that all the others are guaranteed to have a relatively close connection to.
568	Agreement	>in Argentina      >Overall, our data suggest that maturation of the antibody response observed over time after standard Sputnik V vaccination is unable to overcome the ability of omicron to escape the humoral response induced by the vaccine, emphasising the need to administer a booster dose urgently. Booster vaccination combining other vaccine platforms would be an option to further increase neutralising antibody levels against the omicron variant.
584	Agreement	A couple of questions on the science of antibodies for anyone qualified:   1.  Is there a reason why humans don't tend to hold onto coronavirus antibodies?  I've read a couple of 2020 preprints on spike antibodies being somewhat cross reactive with endogenous human proteins (from covid infection, this was pre-vaccine)  Is it possible that waning humoral immunity is "by design" to avoid this, leaving cellular immunity to protect long term against serious illness/death?     2.  If Omicron displaces delta completely such that risk of Delta infection is removed, is it a possibility that boosting with the wuhan variant spike after an Omicron breakthrough is counter productive because you'd already be producing Omicron specific antibodies?    I'm a relative layman, so please forgive me if this breaks rules or highlights my naivety.
374	Agreement	I thought the real goal was not so much omicron but inevitable variants dependent from omicron and thus further abstracted from the earlier strain.  Having something ready in case that‚Äôs needed and can be quickly deployed.  The real test would be what comes next.
493	Disagreement	Too little data, too many combinations of hybrid immunity, that's my guess.
58	Agreement	But we can't randomize across different cohorts as they are looking at people with different vaccination histories?
437	Disagreement	Can your immune system for lack of a  better term wear out with constant boosting like that? I read from an immunologist on Twitter that there is some evidence of this in other viruses but I don‚Äôt have literature to link to
211	Agreement	The study states "Eligible medical encounters were defined as those among adults aged ‚â•18 years with a COVID-19‚Äìlike illness diagnosis" so I don't think asymptomatic patients were included.
575	Agreement	>Who here still supports mandated double vaccinations for healthy young males who have already had Covid-19? And if you do, what is your scientific rationale for doing so in 13-16 years age group?  Covid by itself is causing myocarditis. If you are at risk of having it from vaccine, you are at risk getting it when infected.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988375/
797	Agreement	Older (2020) article but I did not see it posted yet.  >**Abstract**  Distrust in scientific expertise1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 is dangerous. **Opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks2,3,4, as happened for measles in 20195,6. Homemade remedies7,8 and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet, as well as dismissals of expert advice9,10,11**. There is a lack of understanding about how this distrust evolves at the system level13,14. Here we provide a map of the contention surrounding vaccines that has emerged from the global pool of around three billion Facebook users. Its core reveals a multi-sided landscape of unprecedented intricacy that involves nearly 100 million individuals partitioned into highly dynamic, interconnected clusters across cities, countries, continents and languages. Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral. **Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade.** Insights provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views. Our results challenge the conventional thinking about undecided individuals in issues of contention surrounding health, shed light on other issues of contention such as climate change11, and highlight the key role of network cluster dynamics in multi-species ecologies15.
532	Neutral	> Post-vaccination symptoms (fatigue, joint pain, and taste and olfactory abnormalities) were relieved, worsened, and unchanged in 7 (16.7%), 9 (21.4%), and 26 (61.9%) patients, respectively. Ratios of pre- and post-vaccination antibody titers were 53, 40, and 174 in the unchanged, relief, and worsened groups, respectively. The worsened group had the significantly highest antibody titer ratio (p = 0.02). The higher increased rate of the antibody titer in the worsened group than in the non-worsened group suggests an excessive immune response to vaccination associated with worsening of sequelae. **Although patients with Long COVID should be vaccinated**, additional concerns should be addressed.  emphasis added  First off, it doesn‚Äôt seem scientific to make a claim like ‚ÄúX should be done‚Äù.    But even if we are to do ethical calculations in science papers, is this correct? Is the health benefit of reducing infencfion rate worth the cost of worsening people‚Äôs long covid symptoms? How is that quantified or determined?    Unfortunately I‚Äôm lazy so I didn‚Äôt go beyond the abstract but the reasoning seems to be skipped here.    Were they just clumsily attempting to say something like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not our intention to argue in favor of a change in vaccination rates or targets, but there are some side effects to prepare for and mitigate‚Äù?
133	Agreement	It's a good question -- the booster performance is going to be much more salient, and for my part I wonder why they didn't recruit a much bigger cohort for that -- ~600 seems a bit low to pick up potential variation depending on the immune response to the first course.
829	Agreement	So let me get this right..young males are at higher risk of mycoarditis from vaccination than from a covid infection?
525	Neutral	**Abstract**   Intramuscular vaccines have greatly reduced hospitalization and death due to severe COVID-19. However, most countries are experiencing a resurgence of infection driven predominantly by the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. In response, booster dosing of COVID-19 vaccines has been implemented in many countries to address waning immunity and reduced protection against the variants. However, **intramuscular boosting fails to elicit mucosal immunity and therefore does not solve the problem of persistent viral carriage and transmission**, even in patients protected from severe disease. In this study, two doses of stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P)-based intramuscular vaccine adjuvanted with Alum/CpG1018, MVC-COV1901, were used as a primary vaccination series, followed by an intranasal booster vaccination with nanoemulsion (NE01)-adjuvanted S-2P vaccine in a hamster model to demonstrate immunogenicity and protection from viral challenge. Here we report that this vaccination regimen resulted not only in the induction of robust immunity and protection against weight loss and lung pathology following challenge with SARS-CoV-2, but also led to increased viral clearance from both upper and lower respiratory tracts. **Our findings showed that intramuscular MVC-COV1901 vaccine followed by a booster with intranasal NE01-adjuvanted vaccine promotes protective immunity against both viral infection and disease**, suggesting that this immunization protocol may offer a solution in addressing a significant, unmet medical need for both the COVID-19 and future pandemics.
759	Agreement	It's entirely possible that's true for other variants and not Omicron. Or that Omicron is just less likely to cause anosmia. But I think the data wasn't very convincing on it previously anyway.
803	Agreement	Over what time frame does the Infection-neutralizing antibody response last?
393	Agreement	So if they find 3 shots don't work in 3/4 year olds, they won't resubmit 2 shots for 6mo-2 years?
6	Agreement	>  What these studies are teaching us are the rules of engagement of the immune system when you boost with a variant vaccine,‚Äù says Montefiori. Those rules suggest that single boost of a variant-matched vaccine probably isn‚Äôt the solution, he says.  Still have my fingers crossed for the Walter Reed shot.
747	Agreement	Is this ever be likely to really happen though? The injections are intramuscular and shouldn‚Äôt really migrate much let alone get into the brain, should they?
624	Agreement	As a further note of interest, this is all data from England only, where vaccine injections with aspiration technique aren't mandated. [There are concerns](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34406358/) that badly placed injections can result in adverse reactions, like myocarditis.
855	Agreement	That study is mentioning secondary attack rate, meaning the people getting infected were unvaccinated. Which also explains the high SAR for vaccinated people getting omicron (immune escape). I didn't see any mention that vaccinated index cases were less like to transmit it to others in that study unless I missed it. A similar [household study in the UK] (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(21\)00648-4/fulltext) found:  > SAR among household contacts exposed to fully vaccinated index cases was similar to household contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases (25% [95% CI 15‚Äì35] for vaccinated vs 23% [15‚Äì31] for unvaccinated).
676	Agreement	Here you [go](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.30.21264363v1).
276	Agreement	You tell me what "efficacy" means in terms of probability and I'll tell you why the average is 11%. E.g, if you take it as a multiplicative model where 43% efficacy means 1 - .43 = .57 and -43% means 1.43, the geometric mean is around 10%
938	Agreement	Why wouldn't you put it in context for the age/sex that should actually think about it rather than the entire population?  (Also, I thought VAERS reports not worth paying attention to... did thus view change recently?)
362	Agreement	Effectiveness dropped to 12% by 34 days in 5-11? Wow‚Ä¶.
592	Neutral	Abstract  >Vaccination is an effective public health measure, yet vaccine efficacy varies across different populations. Adjuvants improve vaccine efficacy but often increase reactogenicity. An unconventional behavioral ‚Äúadjuvant‚Äù is physical exercise at the time of vaccination. Here, in separate experiments, we examined the effect of 90-minute light- to moderate-intensity cycle ergometer or outdoor walk/jog aerobic exercise performed once after immunization on serum antibody response to three different vaccines (2009 pandemic influenza H1N1, seasonal influenza, and COVID-19). Exercise took place after influenza vaccination or after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A mouse model of influenza A immunization was used to examine the effect of exercise on antibody response and the role of IFNŒ± as a potential mechanism by treating mice with anti-IFNŒ± antibody. The results show that 90 min of exercise consistently increased serum antibody to each vaccine four weeks post-immunization, and IFNŒ± may partially contribute to the exercise-related benefit. Exercise did not increase side effects after the COVID-19 vaccination. These findings suggest that adults who exercise regularly may increase antibody response to influenza or COVID-19 vaccine by performing a single session of light- to moderate-intensity exercise post-immunization.
353	Agreement	But there is no fully approved alternative not using mRNA technology, I think there is a good argument that an alternative vaccine should be EUA'd for people with a history of myocarditis, I think a vaccine with more traditional technology actually would convince some people on the fence.
527	Neutral	**This is the peer-reviewed version of [this previously discussed preprint](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/qhfvfb/safety_monitoring_of_mrna_vaccines_administered/)**
415	Agreement	What about vaccinated who catch COVID?
238	Neutral	Unless there‚Äôs another super contagious variant coming (like last summer‚Äôs delta peak).
893	Agreement	They say the latest booster date was 2 December 2021, so several people might have just had their booster, not entirely clear. Earliest booster date was in October, so there is at least one person with >2 weeks post booster.
553	Agreement	> Take home antibody tests an hour before to catch people during infectious window would have been more likely to catch this.  Take home antibody tests? Are you meaning to say antigen tests? AKA, rapid tests? Sensitivity of those tests varies, Abbot / BinaxNOW reported about 65% or so.
205	Agreement	The longer copy/paste from their discussion:  ‚ÄúWe suspect that the acute cardiac changes seen in these two boys are the result of epinephrine-mediated effects on cardiomyocytes. These occurrences generally have a favorable prognosis, however, some patients may die from the underlying (non-cardiac) cause of the myocardial findings (e.g., such as with subarachnoid hemorrhage). Histologically, diffuse hypereosinophilic myocytes, contraction bands, and coagulative myocytolysis are seen, with a patchy and random pattern and a neutrophilic/mononuclear cell infiltrate. With longer survival, global myocardial ischemia may develop.37  This post-vaccine reaction may represent an overly exuberant immune response and the myocardial injury is mediated by similar immune mechanisms as described with SARS-COV-2 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) cytokine storms.38 MIS-C is a rare systemic illness presenting with persistent fever and extreme inflammation following exposure to SARS- CoV-2. Affected children have persistent fever and may have acute abdominal pain with diarrhea or vomiting, muscle pain/malaise, and hypotension. Other reported symptoms include rashes, enlarged lymph nodes, and swelling.‚Äù
790	Agreement	Not to the unvaccinated? I'm assuming so
13	Agreement	> how soon can they get results from this and start wide scale production?  Risk production can begin before they have trial results.   There are press reports that Pfizer will be making 50 to 100 million doses "at risk" (which is to say, if the trial says it doesn't work they will have to discard it.)
233	Agreement	Those three dose titers for the GSK series are something.
515	Agreement	(2) After a booster it is ‚Äúancient‚Äù memory b-cells, probably induced by common cold coronaviruses, that were mostly activated.   [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268554v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268554v1)  >B cells derived from ancient pre-existing memory cells and that recognize the full-length wild-type spike with the highest avidity after boosting are the B cells that also bind the Omicron variant spike protein.
173	Agreement	Short answer - probably not - will be going on for a long time to come but the good news is that **this study suggests the emergence of new variants will be less and less dramatic as time passes**.  &#x200B;  Long answer:  At the beginning of the pandemic there was a lot of academic discussion about whether SARS-CoV-2 was already "fully" or "well" adapted to human hosts by the time it was recognized. For example:  [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1.full](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1.full) (not sure why this was never published so read cautiously I suppose) and [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19818-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19818-2)  This happened before - for example, another betacoronavirus, Human coronavirus HKU1 was not identified until it had probably already been circulating for a long time and, consequently, was likely past any period of rapid host adaptation following zoonosis. This was considered to be unlikely by many for SARS-CoV-2 from the start considering the high pathogenicity.  The consensus shifted over time and it was established that the "mutational repertoire" of the virus allowing for increased fitness within human hosts is pretty big - likely translating into sustained, ongoing human adaptation for a long time - for example: [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2104241118](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2104241118)  The next big question was, basically, do combinations of mutations behave much differently than the sum of the individual effects of each mutation, "epistasis". If this is true, then not only is the single-mutation repertoire vast, but the room to evolve for SARS-CoV-2 (through combinations of mutations) within human hosts is practically unmeasurable. This has been established for limited cases (for example as discussed here: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228362100276X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228362100276X)) and if this were shown to be "robust" or "widespread" that would be concerning.  This study demonstrates (computationally, so take it with a grain of salt) that this epistasis in the receptor binding domain is limited - "boring" as the authors state - indicating that the single mutational repertoire is a very good approximation of the total evolutionary "flexibility" of the interactions between the spike protein and the host receptor. In other words, while there will likely be plenty of new variants emerging over time (unfortunately possibly for many years) their characteristics will be similar to what we've already seen before.  Another caveat is that epistasis may happen between parts of proteins or different proteins that are much farther apart in the viral genome than what is studied here and mutations in other regions (for example the N-terminal domain: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02858-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02858-9)) may provide greater evolutionary flexibility.
175	Agreement	So all these studies were only done on animals, no studies yet on humans or real world effectiveness. I don't see how an omnicron specific booster *couldn't* be more effective than the current boosters, unless omicron's ability to evade antibodies has nothing to do with it simply "looking" different than the other variants.
663	Agreement	Exactly what I was thinking.  It would make sense for it to have very little to do with Delta for example because it forked off of wuhan before Delta was even a thing.  With more than 50 changes on the spike, honestly it would have been dumb luck for it to have anything in common with Delta's spike.  That's just so many different variables between the two.     I feel like the future holds quadrivalent type vaccines like we have for the flu in our future.  &#x200B;  But more and more as we study this, I feel like the more we learn the more the US Army's vaccine seems like it may be the one that is ahead of the game and built to deal with how this is panning out.
404	Agreement	The US distributor of Covaxin pulled their EUA application and applied for a full approval.  I don't know why they decided to do that, as it seems like a slower path.  There may also be reluctance to approve a vaccine in a pediatric population that hasn't been used in adults (in the US, anyway).  I'm not sure that's a scientific rationale, but could be.
593	Neutral	Abstract  Background  Data conflict on whether vaccination decreases severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load. The objective of this analysis was to compare baseline viral load and symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults enrolled in a randomized trial of outpatient COVID-19 treatment.  Methods  Baseline data from the first 433 sequential participants enrolling into the COVID-OUT trial were analyzed. Adults aged 30-85 with a body mass index (BMI) >= 25kg/m 2 were eligible within 3 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and <7 days of symptoms. Log 10 PCR viral loads were normalized to human RNase P by vaccination status, by time from vaccination, and by symptoms.  Results  274 participants with known vaccination status contributed optional nasal swabs for viral load measurement: median age 46 years; median BMI 31.2 kg/m 2 (IQR, 27.4, 36.4). Overall, 159 (58%) were women, and 217 (80%) were white. The mean relative log10 viral load for those vaccinated <6 months from date of enrollment was 0.11 (95% CI, -0.48, 0.71), which was significantly lower than the unvaccinated group (p = 0.01). Those vaccinated >= 6 months prior to enrollment did not differ from the unvaccinated with respect to viral load (mean 0.99, 95% CI, -0.41 to 2.40; p = 0.85). The vaccinated group had fewer moderate/severe symptoms of subjective fever, chills, myalgias, nausea, and diarrhea (all P<0.05).  Conclusions  These data suggest that vaccination within 6 months of infection is associated with a lower viral load, and vaccination was associated with a lower likelihood of having systemic symptoms.
608	Agreement	All the figures they provide tell us that it is far worse than mRNA vaccine when the antigen is deviated from the ancestral strain(note it is using log scale to represent, each tick represents a ten fold difference).  ratio doesn't matter in neutralizing the virus
630	Agreement	Beta blockers, a cheap and readily available class of drugs with few side effects (short term and at low doses) may be effective against myocarditis and a week or two could be prescribed as a preventative. https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00258.2005
869	Agreement	The most common nomenclature I have seen used by professionals is "infection-induced immunity", but there is a certain aesthetic to calling it natural immunity... which will be difficult to overcome even if it is not correct.
721	Agreement	I‚Äôd guess that the controls are a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated, which makes sense of the prevalence being between the vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, but the page itself doesn‚Äôt seem to indicate.
316	Disagreement	They are not going to look for a previous infection. What kind of study is this? If one cohort got more infections previously it‚Äôs going to affect the results dramatically. Also sample size is already quite low and I‚Äôm sure a lot of people in this study will be eliminated due to Omicron infection while in trial. I think this study needs a bigger sample and infection-naive people.
45	Agreement	as long as your randomization isn't unlucky
481	Disagreement	Sweden only introduced vaccine passes in December, so this explanation is unlikely. It's possible that people just changed their behavior after vaccination independently of any formal rules.
31	Agreement	A couple questions:  1) the release says they are trying to achieve more durable protection against infection. How do they do that? 2) how soon can they get results from this and start wide scale production?
751	Agreement	It does not appear that they assessed effectiveness of prior BA.1 infection vs. against infection, hospitalization, or death from BA.2 infection.  If you disagree, please point me a page within the PDF.
502	Disagreement	Why are they not at least updating the mRNA to match the newer strains? The circulating variants are now more than 2 years diverged from the sequence used in the vaccine--why should we expect the existing vaccines to become anything but less-and-less effective as time goes on?
380	Agreement	I'm not sure. Perhaps it was the "traditional vaccine" portion. I should clarify, I'm not at all against m-RNA tech. Don't want to get into anecdotes, but I'm very "pro" m-RNA. My purpose of stating that was moreso it's unlikely to have surprise adverse reactions from an inactivated virus type vaccine, and having one like that might convince more parents to vaccinate their kids.
906	Agreement	This would imply that the vaccine would work as a therapeutic then for long COVID for most symptoms after emergence?
861	Agreement	The consensus you're referring to was established pre-omicron. This study speaks specifically to omicron which we know the vaccines have been more challenged by. It's not surprising to see efficacy vary according to the variant in question.  So yes, Pfizer (and Moderna) 2 shots was superior to JNJ 1 shot by a notable margin. And yes, Pfizer (and Moderna) 2 shots were still superior (by a relatively narrow margin) than 2 shots of J&J. So it's certainly to be expected 3 shots of either of the mRNAs would be superior to 2 of J&J -- against all variants prior to Omicron.  Now, we see how Pfizer's 2+1 compares against J&J's 1+1, which is impressive for J&J.  As it's commonly believed that J&J should've always been a 2-shot, it's interesting to contemplate what the efficacy would be today if we were comparing like-for-like -- with a 2+1 J&J shot vs the mRNAs 2+1, especially against omicron given this study.  The South Africa study of J&J is also of particular relevance for two reasons, 1) Omicron is believed to have originated in South Africa, and 2) 42% of all South African vaccinations are J&J (as of November 2021).
534	Neutral	> Abstract  > NDV-HXP-S is a recombinant Newcastle disease virus based-vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which expresses an optimized (HexaPro) spike protein on its surface. The vaccine can be produced in embryonated chicken eggs using the same process as that employed for the production of influenza virus vaccines. Here we performed a secondary analysis of the antibody responses after vaccination with inactivated NDV-HXP-S in a Phase I clinical study in Thailand. The SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing and spike binding activity of NDV-HXP-S post-vaccination serum samples was compared to that of matched samples from mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccinees. Neutralizing activity of sera from NDV-HXP-S vaccinees was comparable to that of individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2. Interstingly, the spike binding activity of the NDV-HXP-S vaccinee samples was lower than that of sera obtained from individuals vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine. This let us to calculate ratios between binding and neutralizing antibody titers. Samples from NDV-HXP-S vaccinees had binding to neutralizing activity ratios similar to those of convalescent sera suggesting a very high proportion of neutralizing antibodies and low non-neutralizing antibody titers. Further analysis showed that, in contrast to mRNA vaccination, which induces strong antibody titers to the receptor binding domain (RBD), the N-terminal domain, and the S2 domain, NDV-HXP-S vaccination induces a very RBD focused response with little reactivity to S2. This explains the high proportion of neutralizing antibodies since most neutralizing epitopes are located in the RBD. In conclusion, vaccination with inactivated NDV-HXP-S induces a high proportion of neutralizing antibodies and absolute neutralizing antibody titers comparable to those after mRNA vaccination.
168	Neutral	Regarding the third dose, or booster, it‚Äôs already in trials:  ‚ÄúOn December 17, 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the companies would test a third 3 ¬µg dose given at least two months after the second dose in children under age 5 and a third dose of the 10 ¬µg formulation in children 5 to under 12 years of age.‚Äù
798	Agreement	Omicron as well. [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.27.21268278v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.27.21268278v1)  "**We found an increased transmission for unvaccinated individuals, and a reduced transmission for booster-vaccinated individuals, compared to fully vaccinated individuals.** Comparing households infected with the Omicron to Delta VOC, we found an 1.17 (95%-CI: 0.99-1.38) times higher SAR for unvaccinated, 2.61 times (95%-CI: 2.34-2.90) higher for fully vaccinated and 3.66 (95%-CI: 2.65-5.05) times higher for booster-vaccinated individuals, demonstrating strong evidence of immune evasiveness of the Omicron VOC."
111	Agreement	I‚Äôm concerned that this is catching people just going to the ER or UC because they have mild symptoms, perhaps with the hope of getting a test because they failed to be able to find or schedule one elsewhere. This data is from a time period in which tests were exceedingly hard to find and in exceedingly high demand.
521	Neutral	**Abstract** In this brief communication we are showing original research results with early estimates from Danish nationwide databases of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the novel SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) up to five months after a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 -19 vaccines. Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular, we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively, in the first month after primary vaccination. However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6%, 95% CI: 30.4 to 70.4%).
680	Agreement	How else would you make sure that your preventative REALLY REALLY worked?
450	Disagreement	I don't understand how people can think the vaccine will be worse for them than when they get covid.  If you get the vaccine, it's just the spike protein that binds to those ACE-2 sites, where as with actually getting covid, not only do you get that same spike protein, but you get the WHOLE fucking virus. Wouldn't it make sense that any danger the vaccine might pose is multiplied if one actually gets covid?  This is where I really do not understand the anti-vax movement. You're going to get covid eventually. It's inevitable. So you're gonna get that spike protein either way. Why not just get vaxxed and build up your immune system?  Makes absolutely 0 sense
89	Agreement	Haven‚Äôt heard from the Novavax vaccine in a long time, someone mind filling me in what happened?
384	Agreement	Is it that people are thinking of the overall risk more in terms of, what is the likelihood a young person will get covid and then get myocarditis as a result versus what is the likelihood of a young person getting myocarditis as a result of the vaccine? I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm not expressing myself precisely enough, I don‚Äôt know anything about stats, etc. But I‚Äôm trying to understand.
756	Agreement	It wouldn‚Äôt really be a prior Covid-19 infection if it occurred after vaccination started. Even the first dose by itself offers quite a bit of protection less than 2 weeks after the shot. I guess you could could argue they could have started 12 days after the first vaccination, but that‚Äôs really splitting hairs.  https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577   ‚ÄúBetween the first dose and the second dose, 39 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 82 cases in the placebo group were observed, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 52% (95% CI, 29.5 to 68.4) during this interval and indicating early protection by the vaccine, starting as soon as 12 days after the first dose.‚Äú
691	Agreement	I could be reading this wrong, but I think the study says "MRNA vaccine plus J&J booster more effective that MRNA vaccine plus MRNA booster."  In other words, exposure to 2 different vaccines is better than just exposing the body to one.  Which we have always suspected but had little study evidence to support (most companies don't want to say "use the other guys product after ours, instead of using our product twice" so don't support studies that mix vaccines).  So it could be less "J&J is better" and more "looking at a front and side headshot of a suspect helps you spot them better than looking at the front headshot twice."
795	Agreement	Odds ratio of .08 means if 100 unvaccinated needs icu, only 8 vaccinated needs icu
720	Agreement	I'm talking in hindsight, yes. And we may find Omicron does more damage than we know at the moment.      But, for right now it seems like it was fortunate that Omicron was able to overtake Delta, and if this data is confirmed, it seems like vaccinations made that possible.
562	Agreement	>**Abstract**  >Vaccination-based exposure to spike protein derived from early SARS-CoV-2 sequences is the key public health strategy against COVID-19. Successive waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been characterised by the evolution of highly mutated variants that are more transmissible and that partially evade the adaptive immune response. Omicron is the fifth of these ‚ÄúVariants of Concern‚Äù (VOC) and is characterised by a step change in transmission capability, suggesting significant antigenic and biological change. It is characterised by 45 amino acid substitutions, including 30 changes in the spike protein relative to one of the earliest sequences, Wuhan-Hu-1, of which 15 occur in the receptor binding domain, an area strongly associated with humoral immune evasion. In this study, we demonstrate both markedly decreased neutralisation in serology assays and real-world vaccine effectiveness in recipients of two doses of vaccine, with efficacy partially recovered by a third mRNA booster dose. We also show that immunity from natural infection (without vaccination) is more protective than two doses of vaccine but inferior to three doses. Finally, we demonstrate fundamental changes in the Omicron entry process in vitro, towards TMPRSS2-independent fusion, representing a major shift in the replication properties of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these findings underlie rapid global transmission and may alter the clinical severity of disease associated with the Omicron variant.
376	Agreement	I wish I could find some studies regarding the age 13-16 population. In the US its been 6 months since their last dose and they are not approved for booster shots.  Young immune system appears good on its own, and having a 2 vaccine dose series is likely protective even after 6 months or so, but it would be nice to see some data.
178	Agreement	Some papers measure *neutralizing* antibodies to estimate vaccine efficacy, some just measure antibodies. Am I correct in thinking that while neutralizing antibodies can prevent symptomatic infection, having non-neutralizing antibodies can still help reduce disease severity?
681	Agreement	How many of the documented cases of myocarditis resulted in mortality, severe injury, or sequelae?  Obviously myocarditis is a concern, but severity and long-term sequelae should also be part of that equation.   I have still not been able to determine what is the baseline of mild, transient myocarditis among various demographics, and whether this mostly occurs with mRNA vaccines, or with other vaccines or infections as well.   Does this result in any injury to the patients?  Are there risks of weakening cardiac tissue or reducing output over time?  Is this a risk for other mRNA vaccines or future class of drugs?  What about AVV gene therapies?
425	Agreement	yes.  the logistics are very hard though.  Great Lakes all the way to the mason dixon and towards Maine all gets a spring and fall wave.  The South gets a summer and winter wave.  You'd have to give people boosters twice a season.  That much boosting(we're already boosting to much) is going to cause massive imprinting issues that may take years to sort out in the immune system.
414	Agreement	What about the risk for vaccinated people who get Covid versus unvaccinated people who get Covid? Seems like everybody, included the vaccinated, is going to get Covid if they haven‚Äôt already so it sounds like would be relevant data.
817	Agreement	Results  Among 422‚ÄØ034 vaccinated individuals (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [17.4] years; 236‚ÄØ437 [56.0%] women) and 1‚ÄØ645‚ÄØ397 matched unvaccinated individuals (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [17.5] years; 922‚ÄØ937 [56.1%] women), VE was 76% (95% CI, 75%-77%) for COVID-19 infections and 81% (95% CI, 78%-82%) for COVID-19‚Äìrelated hospitalizations. VE was stable for at least 180 days after vaccination and over calendar time. Among states with high Delta variant incidence, VE during June to August 2021 was 74% (95% CI, 71%-77%) for infections and 81% (95% CI, 75%-86%) for hospitalizations. VE for COVID-19 was higher in individuals younger than 65 years (78%; 95% CI, 77%-79%) and lower in immunocompromised patients (64%; 95% CI, 59%-68%). All estimates were corrected for vaccination underrecording; uncorrected VE, which served as a lower bound, was 66% (95% CI, 64%-67%) for any recorded COVID-19 infection and 72% (95% CI, 69%-74%) for COVID-19‚Äìrelated hospitalization.  Conclusions and Relevance  This cohort study in US clinical practice showed stable VE of Ad26.COV2.S for at least 6 months before as well as during the time the Delta variant emerged and became dominant.
762	Agreement	It's their AS03 adjuvant and I believe it is used in the Sanofi and the SK Bioscience protein based vaccines.
249	Agreement	What about the [new UK SIREN study findings](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.29.21267006v1)? Are they perhaps basing the 85% for Delta off that, since the original SIREN study was pre-Delta? I‚Äôve only skimmed the preprint but it doesn‚Äôt look like the writeup is as detailed as the original published SIREN study in the Lancet, and it doesn't discuss the "confirmed, probable, or possible" infections.  EDIT: Sorry, I was incorrect. Just checked the actual full pdf and they do cite the original SIREN study published in the Lancet. Still interested in what you think of the new SIREN study findings though since you appear to be knowledgable on this topic
492	Disagreement	This study seems to have more conjectural elements than many studies, ie assuming omicron based on a proxy designator. Their tables are also very hard to read. Would love to see better data and a better presentation.
36	Agreement	Among other things, I think it might be a reminder that any single study isn't necessarily conclusive.    Plus, hospitalizations are only part of the picture - it will take months to find out if an omicron infection opens us up to the possibility of long Covid.  With the infection numbers we're going to see, even if just 5% get long Covid symptoms, that's a huge problem.
874	Agreement	The paper states the booster group's efficacy is relative to a 2x vaccinated group.
604	Agreement	After asking my question, I spent some time on proteinatlas dot org (not sure whether I can link to it).  It certainly seems that the older strains prefer organs high in tmprss2 like lungs, kidneys, and GI tract.   Early 2020 was scary with how much we learned about its non-respiratory effects (heart attack, blood clots, stroke, etc).  Hopefully we won't uncover any nasty surprises this time.
403	Agreement	The time period covered here is right after vaccination,  when there would be no such concerns.
518	Neutral	**Abstract**  **Background.** The role of SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis of testicular damage is uncertain.  **Methods.** We investigated the virological, pathological, and immunological changes in testes of hamsters challenged by SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and its variants by intranasal or direct testicular inoculation using influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 as control.  **Results.** Besides self-limiting respiratory tract infection, intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge caused acute decrease in sperm count, and serum testosterone and inhibin B at 4 to 7 days post-infection (dpi), and subsequently reduced testicular size and weight, and serum sex hormone level at 42 to 120 dpi. Acute histopathological damage with varying degree of testicular inflammation, haemorrhage, and necrosis, degeneration of seminiferous tubules and disruption of orderly spermatogenesis were seen with increasing virus inoculum. Degeneration and necrosis of Sertoli and Leydig cells were found. Though viral loads and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapid (N) protein expression were markedly lower in testicular than lung tissues, direct intra-testicular injection showed N expressing interstitial cells and epididymal epithelial cells. Control intranasal or intra-testicular challenge by A(H1N1)pdm09 showed no testicular infection or damage. From 7 to 120 dpi, degeneration and apoptosis of seminiferous tubules, immune complex deposition and depletion of spermatogenic cell and spermatozoa persisted. Intranasal challenge with Omicron and Delta variants could also induce similar testicular changes. These testicular damages can be prevented by vaccination.  **Conclusions.** SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute testicular damage with subsequent chronic asymmetric testicular atrophy and associated hormonal changes despite a self-limiting pneumonia in hamsters. Awareness of possible hypogonadism and subfertility is important in managing convalescent COVID-19 males.
867	Agreement	The large negative VE at 91-150 days is shocking. The authors suggest behavioral differences, which is definitely plausible ‚Äî but then why are all the other intervals positive? I‚Äôm having trouble doing back of the napkin math where this makes sense, since it seems like explaining the 91-150 result behaviorally would also involve the previous intervals being very very high once also behaviorally adjusted, (so VE would go way up), but that would make those intervals much higher than we‚Äôve seen with other studies..
512	Agreement	"for individuals with natural immunity, there was no advantage to more than one dose of vaccine, and **those who received two doses were at significantly higher risk of getting COVID-19** than those who received a single dose"  It will be interesting to see if this finding will be replicated in other studies
904	Agreement	This tracks. I‚Äôve been baffled by the suggestion of many to get vaccinated or get a booster two weeks after recovering from covid. This just flies against all logic and knowledge of basic immunology to me. I thought 90 days but 6 months sounds about right too
602	Agreement	Actually 0.01% if you're a 16-17 year old boy. Not a big proportion at all but 10x higher than the total risk for the population.  Nevertheless even for that group the risk of myocarditis due to covid is higher.
291	Disagreement	I still remain frustrated by all of these studies doing nothing to assess how much cryptic spread their unvaccinated group has.  We're 2 years into this pandemic now and its becoming harder and harder to believe that there's so many completely unexposed people out there.  We also need to have an assessment of how many hard-to-infect people are left in the unvaccinated group (people whose biology / immune system just isn't very permissive to viral replication).  Some waning may also represent the accumulation of immunity in the unvaccinated group over time.
311	Disagreement	The most glaring issue is the entirely misleading last sentence of the Abstract: "We also show that BNT162b2 mRNA is reverse transcribed intracellularly into DNA in as fast as 6 h upon BNT162b2 exposure."         Given how blatantly misleading this sentence is, I can only think it was deliberate, which is one of the several reasons this reads like propaganda rather than a reputable journal article. Unless you invest the time and have the knowledge to understand the rest of the article, you will misunderstand this sentence to mean that they observed integration of the mRNA into the DNA genome, i.e., becomes part of our permanent DNA. However, this is NOT what it means whatsoever. What it actually means is that they observed that the vaccine mRNA was reverse transcribed into DNA **amplicons**, i.e., **a piece of DNA** resulting from the reverse transcription. They did NOT observe any integration into the DNA genome, as they explain near the end of the article:         "Our study shows that BNT162b2 can be reverse transcribed to DNA in liver cell line Huh7, and this may give rise to the concern if BNT162b2-derived DNA may be integrated into the host genome and affect the integrity of genomic DNA, which may potentially mediate genotoxic side effects. **At this stage, we do not know if DNA reverse transcribed from BNT162b2 is integrated into the cell genome.** Further studies are needed to demonstrate the effect of BNT162b2 on genomic integrity, including whole genome sequencing of cells exposed to BNT162b2, as well as tissues from human subjects who received BNT162b2 vaccination." (emphasis added to the not-quite-English grammar)         Even if it turns out that the vaccine mRNA is integrated into the DNA genome at some level, this would not necessarily mean that the integrated portion of the mRNA would result in any meaningful or harmful gene expression.        It is also worth noting the authors' caveat that this level of reverse transcription would probably not happen in most ordinary human cells *in vivo*: "**The cell model that we used in this study is a carcinoma cell line, with active DNA replication which differs from non-dividing somatic cells**. It has also been shown that Huh7 cells display significant \[*sic*\] different gene and protein expression including upregulated proteins involved in RNA metabolism \[56\]."
195	Agreement	That's intended to help distribute the injected material throughout the muscle, which should reduce soreness at the injection site.  Moving the arm was not intended to improve the immune response.

850	Agreement	Thanks for pulling this out, it's what we are waiting for.  Vaxxed and boosted, have no doubts about it keeping me out of the hospital or morgue. My concern is long COVID.   Page 4 in the analysis covers Vaccination before Infection (heading) and pulls from 8 studies.   >Fully vaccinated participants were about half as likely to have symptoms lasting ‚â•28 days than unvaccinated participants (odds ratio [OR] = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.82, p=0.005), whereas partially vaccinated participants were about as likely to have symptoms lasting ‚â•28 days than unvaccinated participants (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.25, p=0.69).  This is good news, still reading to see what else they found
520	Neutral	**Abstract**  Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to dramatically alter the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic. The recently described variant of concern designated Omicron (B.1.1.529) has rapidly spread worldwide and is now responsible for the majority of COVID-19 cases in many countries. Because Omicron was recognized very recently, many knowledge gaps exist about its epidemiology and clinical severity and disease course.  A comprehensive genome sequencing study of SARS-CoV-2 in the Houston Methodist healthcare system identified 862 symptomatic patients with infections caused by Omicron from late November 2021 through December 18, 2021.  Omicron very rapidly increased in only three weeks to cause 90% of all new COVID-19 cases. Compared to patients infected with either Alpha or Delta variants in our healthcare system, Omicron patients were significantly younger, had significantly increased vaccine breakthrough rates, and were significantly less likely to be hospitalized. Omicron patients required less intense respiratory support and had a shorter length of hospital stay, consistent with decreased disease severity. Although the number of Omicron patients we studied is relatively small, in the aggregate the data document the unusually rapid spread and increased occurrence of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant in metropolitan Houston, and provide information about disease character.
953	Agreement	Yes, an embarrassing typo in a perhaps even more embarrassing 95% CI ‚Äî almost 150% wide. The minus sign is included in the results section, and the vastness of the 95% CI is acknowledged in the discussion section, although their phrasing ‚Äúestimated with less precision...‚Äù is arguably a tad understated :)   Methods section: Unvaccinated group was followed up from Nov 20 but part of vaccinated group was followed up from later date ‚Äî if sizable fraction, seems like this could produce large negative bias in VE estimate given ongoing explosive exponential growth in infection rates?   Poor statistics / statistical analysis seems a perhaps more plausible contender in ‚Äòexplaining‚Äô large negative VE estimates?
513	Agreement	"Getting COVID" here makes it sound like a digital 0/1 kind of situation, which isn't how vaccines work. It seems many people who were infected but not symptomatic don't consider themselves having it at all, and those who had breakout symptoms due to decreased neutralizing antibody protection consider themselves "catching covid in spite of the vaccine" even though their t-cell response was still likely very strong.   It's like how sometimes people think that the flu shot "gives them the flu" because they have a mild response from their immune system.
729	Agreement	If it is no longer reliant on TMPRSS2, does that mean we should expect it to target different parts of the body?
970	Disagreement	Any study using front line HCWs as subject matter is really questionable.  These individuals have contact with the actual pathogen(s) on a routine basis, which strongly colors any assumptions made.
918	Agreement	We also don't know *how* Omicron, the only major vaccine evader, happened. We do know there's no realistic possibility it occurred via gradual evolution in a resistant human population. It's too different, too transmissible and many of the changes model as evolutionary failures.
341	Agreement	A while back I heard that a big factor in their delays was getting their manufacturing set up. If that's the case, then a new vaccine shouldn't have the same issues as they could use what they've set up now.  But, we'll see...
761	Agreement	It's not just a Moderna problem though. Even for Pfizer, we see a weaker but clear signal:  **Infection:** 2.02 (1.13 - 3.61)  **Dose 1:** 1.66 (1.14 - 3.41)  **Dose 2:** 3.41 (2.44 - 4.78)  **Dose 3:** 7.60 (1.92 - 30.15)  This is a "bombshell" for the lack of better words. I really wish someone could show this to college administrators who are mandating 3d dose for college students after just 6 months, with no regard for recent breakthrough infections.  Edit:  I know the CIs overlap, but the fact that the point estimate of infection (2.02) is clearly outside of Dose 2's CI (2.44 - 4.78) is already concerning. I'm merely advocating for caution for healthy young males for whom Covid is a miniscule threat.
124	Agreement	Isn‚Äôt exercising going to help in general against COVID though?
304	Disagreement	Only 18 kids were used to develop the dosing size for this age group
881	Agreement	The Zoe covid study has shown other symptoms are much more common than the classic three. Their website keeps an up to date list of the most common.
742	Agreement	Interesting, what‚Äôs the tech? Their original covid vaccine was with a traditional inactivated virus approach, right?
645	Agreement	Do not provide anecdotes or personally identifying information. All discussions should be abstract in that regard.  Read the rules. We are strict about this.
191	Neutral	That 100% shouldn't be taken at face value. In the week that they got the 100% figure from, <5% of kids (5-11) were fully vaccinated. This plus the vaccine having 66% efficacy vs injection led to \~200 vaccinated kids and \~10,000 unvaccinated kids reporting as Covid-positive that week. 18 unvaccinated kids were hospitalised that week. Ignoring the lag between testing positive and being hospitalised, roughly 2 in 1000 unvaccinated C+ kids got hospitalised. So out of 200 vaccinated C+ kids, you would fully expect 0 to be hospitalised, even if the vaccine did nothing to reduce severity.  So while literally 0 vaccinated kids were hospitalised that week, mathematically resulting in 100% vaccine efficacy vs hospitalisation, in reality there were too few vaccinated C+ kids to draw a meaningful conclusion.  The next week, VE vs hospitalisation had already fallen to 73% (but again with super wide confidence intervals), then "rose" to 82% in the third week.
103	Agreement	I think they are basing on the macaques study, on the mice study the nAbs were much better ... it's just that the lung and nasal tests didn't show major differences.  Looking at human infection studies, I think we need to wait for clinical human tests first. Because omicron infections seem to induce strong protection against omicron, with 2 dose breakthroughs here doing better than 3 doses:  - https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.09.22270692v1.full.pdf+html
658	Agreement	Doesn‚Äòt it? The conclusion seem to exactly indicate that:  ‚Äûcontributing to the rapid rise‚Äú sounds a lot like ‚Äûhas a higher chance of infection among the vaccinated‚Äú.
570	Agreement	>NEW YORK & MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the initiation of a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an Omicron-based vaccine candidate in healthy adults 18 through 55 years of age. The study will have three cohorts examining different regimens of the current Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or an Omicron-based vaccine. The study will draw upon some participants from the companies‚Äô Phase 3 COVID-19 booster study and is part of their ongoing efforts to address Omicron and determine the potential need for variant-based vaccines.  >‚ÄúWhile current research and real-world data show that boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalization with Omicron, we recognize the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address Omicron and new variants in the future,‚Äù said Kathrin U. Jansen, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. ‚ÄúStaying vigilant against the virus requires us to identify new approaches for people to maintain a high level of protection, and we believe developing and investigating variant-based vaccines, like this one, are essential in our efforts to towards this goal.‚Äù  >‚ÄúVaccines continue to offer strong protection against severe disease caused by Omicron. Yet, emerging data indicate vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild to moderate disease wanes more rapidly than was observed with prior strains,‚Äù said Prof. Ugur Sahin, CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. ‚ÄúThis study is part of our science-based approach to develop a variant-based vaccine that achieves a similar level of protection against Omicron as it did with earlier variants but with longer duration of protection.‚Äù  >The study will evaluate up to 1,420 participants across the three cohorts:  >* Cohort #1 (n = 615): Received two doses of the current Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 90-180 days prior to enrollment; in the study, participants will receive one or two doses of the Omicron-based vaccine  >* Cohort #2 (n = 600): Received three doses of the current Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 90-180 days prior to enrollment; in the study, participants will receive one dose of the current Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or the Omicron-based vaccine  >* Cohort #3 (n=205): Vaccine-na√Øve participants will receive three doses of the Omicron-based vaccine  >Clinical and real-world data continue to find people who are vaccinated, particularly those that have received a booster, maintain a high level of protection against Omicron, particularly against severe disease and hospitalization. The companies have previously announced that they expect to produce four billion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in 2022, and this capacity is not expected to change if an adapted vaccine is required.
858	Agreement	That‚Äôs a start but it means close to nothing without knowing the percentage of the population vaccinated and the percentage of vaccinated that are boosted.
427	Disagreement	> how could boosting with the same vaccine would elicit broader response/cross-reactivity knowing that the same original antigen is presented to the immune system?  We don't know yet. mRNAs are pushing boundaries in that department.
962	Agreement	Yup and evidence that we were probably testing too much with rt-pcr. If we tested as much for other respiratory diseases, we'd probably be shocked at how many people get some sort of cold during the seasons.
297	Disagreement	In the full PDF they give a lot of different theories and don‚Äôt sound particularly sure. But given the boys died in their sleep without anyone trying CPR, their cardiac tissue was uniquely preserved. Even then they gave a lot of options that‚Äôs probably too much to post here but the longer version of their abstract is:  ‚ÄúThe myocardial injury seen in these post-vaccine hearts has a similar histologic appearance as catecholamine-mediated stress cardiomyopathy and severe SARS-COV-2 infection, including ‚Äúmyocarditis‚Äù which is associated with cytokine release syndrome.‚Äù
471	Disagreement	Omicron replaced Delta fast. Don't think they're looking at waning.
991	Disagreement	So, the third exposure against the "original" spike protein encoded in the vaccines grants immunity against current variants.  This is very different than how the flu vaccines (don't) work, right?  The whole reason we have to spin new flu vaccines each year is because there's not much cross-immunity.  Is this a function of the slower rate of mutations in coronaviruses versus flu viruses, or some other dynamic?  E.g. do coronaviruses, regardless of mutation rate, need to remain fairly static in some key region, such as the spike, in order to remain functional?  If so, that would give higher hopes to the ideas for a pan-coronavirus vaccine, no?
225	Agreement	This is really helpful, thank you.
694	Agreement	I have seen it before, so I think it now passed peer review, which doesn't surprise me since it's so extensive and well done.   I don't think the title gives it enough justice, since even the 4th exposure to the spike via convalescents boosters shows a nice improvement, and looking the extended figure 6 this wasn't limited to pure peak antibody volume as we are getting more activity from that volume.  The IQRs and ranges of the convalescents are much superior to X3 exposures (either vaccination or convalescent X2 vaccination). (Edit: this particularly shows with the Delta, Gamma and Omicron responses), too bad we don't have something on IgA and T cells for X4 exposures.
237	Agreement	True, the adeno numbers are a bit weird/confusing
354	Agreement	Could be related to that only vaccinated people where allowed to attend events, nightclubs and so on in combination with the vaccines efficiency against omicron.
239	Neutral	Updated vaccines are [not doing any better in trials than the original shot](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00003-y). This happened with Delta too but the vaccines were so effective then that it didn't matter. But now it does matter, at least if you want to avoid infection.
567	Agreement	>If this holds true it's likely that vaccines saved many lives by giving Omicron an advantage over Delta. Omicron is significantly less likely to cause death and recovery from infection does seem to prevent against reinfection by Delta at least in the near term  I'm not sure we could conclude that with much certainty.  Omicron is currently killing more Americans per capita than delta did at it's peak.    Omicron is more deadly per capita in some places like the United States at their respective peaks, even if it isn't as deadly per case.
992	Disagreement	That's not going to see the light of day. Fauci already eluded to them keeping it for a rainy day.
449	Disagreement	I don't think that's obvious at all. Because 4 shots is too many shots or because 65% efficacy against symptomatic disease isn't good enough?
996	Disagreement	There's no control group, though. What is the prevalence of one or more symptoms like "headache," "fatigue," "cough," and "sore throat" in uninfected people? Zero isn't a reasonable baseline.  For example, in the vaccine trials, about a third of people reported at least one systemic adverse effect (from a very similar list) after receiving the placebo (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788172).
228	Neutral	This one is interesting, no background pathogen mandated immunity to confound the results  > Background: **Hong Kong maintained extremely low circulation of SARS-CoV-2** until a major community epidemic of Omicron **BA.2** starting in January 2022. Both mRNA BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Fosun Pharma) and inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccines are widely available, however coverage has remained low in older adults. Vaccine effectiveness in this predominantly infection-naive population is unknown. Methods: We used individual-level case data on mild/moderate, severe/fatal and fatal hospitalized COVID-19 from December 31, 2021 to March 8, 2022, along with census information and coverage data of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac. We used a negative binomial model, adjusting for age and calendar day to estimate vaccine effectiveness of one, two and three dose schedules of both vaccines, and relative effectiveness by number of doses and vaccine type. Findings: A total of 12.7 million vaccine doses were administered in the 7.3 million population of Hong Kong, and we analyzed data from confirmed cases with mild/moderate (N=5,474), severe/fatal (N=5,294) and fatal (N=4,093) COVID-19. **Two doses** of either vaccine protected **against severe disease and death**, with higher effectiveness among adults **‚â•60 years with BNT162b2 (VE: 88.2%, 95% confidence interval, CI: 84.4%, 91.1%)** compared to **CoronaVac (VE: 74.1%, 95% CI: 67.8%, 79.2%)**. **Three doses** of either vaccine offered very high levels of protection **against severe outcomes (VE: 98.1%, 95% CI: 97.1%, 98.8%)**. Interpretation: Third doses of either BNT162b2 or CoronaVac provide substantial additional protection against severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized, particularly in older adults who received CoronaVac primary schedules. Longer follow-up is needed to assess persistence of different vaccine platforms and schedules.
541	Agreement	> For me this result isn't super surprising considering Moderna's Beta & Delta specific boosters also didn't perform any better than a 3rd shot with the original vaccine (based on wild-type).  [This is incorrect (slide 29)](https://s29.q4cdn.com/745959723/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Moderna-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-\(08.05.21\).pdf).  The beta-only vaccine did nearly twice as well (in titer measurements) against Beta, and nearly as well against Gamma and D614G as the wildtype vaccine.  This is the exact opposite of what the study here has found, where the Omicron vaccine was significantly worse against Omicron than the wildtype vaccine was.  Multivalent vaccines did even better across the board, but unfortunately this study isn't using a multivalent vaccine.  It would be extremely good if we could stop repeating and upvoting this incorrect statement on every vaccine thread.
982	Disagreement	Idk about efficacy. I'm not sure there's enough data for that. For the curious:  Total hospitalizations in the study: 1,313  Breakthroughs: 675  Boosted breakthroughs: 140
744	Agreement	Is imprinting a possibility?  This study looked at people previously infected with pre-Omicron variants and then at the effects of boosting with one or two doses during the Omicron wave.  Perhaps a single dose boosted the immune system to create a wide variety of antibodies, including those that work against omicron, while the second one resulted in a boost with less breadth / more focus on antibodies focused on the original antigen?
433	Disagreement	50% is what (rumored?) was the lowest acceptable for adult c19 vaccines, i think?
222	Agreement	This is a very good point. We're comparing the unvaxxed to a population with likely well over half having natural immunity. That's a MASSIVE confounding factor.
703	Agreement	I think that there is one more important condition, as you determine the mandate policy  based on the available statistics for the entire 13-16 group - that there isn't an identifiable subset of that group for which the data suggests a different policy. For example, if the mandate is overall beneficial for the 13-16, but overall harmful for 13-14, you should not apply it to the entire 13-16.  The above is probably obvious but I'm driving at a different point. A step further: a case in which 70% of kids are overweight and a mandate is net harmful to the remaining 30%. And a final step: a case in which a mandate is harmful to the subset of very healthy kids, who furthermore have greatly reduced odds of getting infected, due to following strict regimen of NPIs. Yet, you'd clump them together in the big demographic, forcing them to take a vaccine that comes with mathematical expectation to do harm (in their specific case).
391	Agreement	Selection bias is more likely. If you considered yourself to be in a high risk group, you were more likely to choose early vaccination.
903	Agreement	This study doesn't say that on the contrary it states triple vaccinated people got in infected with omicron corona variant that seems to evade the immune response (from the abstract). Reasons for them not being admitted to hospital (yet) could be many (age, health, pre-existing conditions, vaccination etc.).  Numerous studies have documented lesser vaccine efficacy against omicron, but efficacy nonetheless. It seems like a reasonable assertion that we don't really know to what extend the vaccines work and for how long (across vaccines and covid-19 strains).
10	Agreement	> compared to delta  The two weeks after is the cut-off where they start counting subjects as having received 2 (or 3) doses. If you get infected less than two weeks after last dose, it's counted in the numbers as having gotten 1 (or 2) dose.
555	Agreement	> The fact that infection + vaccination produces higher titers is not really surprising, even in those who "only" had two doses of vaccine.  Is it a matter of titer, or could there also be more diversity among the antibodies formed following an infection which could help neutralize variants?
666	Agreement	For me this result isn't super surprising considering Moderna's Beta & Delta specific boosters also didn't perform any better than a 3rd shot with the original vaccine (based on wild-type). They shared those results in an earnings call PDF last fall. So it seems like there must be some OAS (Original Antigenic Sin) going on that even prevents a more robust response against Omicron, which is much more mutated than the other VOCs.      The difficult part I think, if these results are confirmed in humans,  is going to be convincing layman that updated boosters based on Omicron offer no benefit and are not needed. The inability to understand that some results are counterintuitive leads to unfair skeptism about vaccines.      If there is a silver lining from my POV, it's that the vast majority of people had their first exposure to Covid19 (virus or vaccine) based on wild-type or one of the much less mutated VOCs. Those VOCs (for instance Delta) are more pathogenic and much more likely to cause death. If Omicron had been the first pathogen to come around it likely would have been difficult to get the immune system to protect against those more virulent variants due to OAS.       _____    Maybe helpful for some - OAS = The term ‚Äúoriginal antigenic sin‚Äù (OAS) was first used in the 1960s to describe how one‚Äôs first exposure to influenza virus shapes the outcome of subsequent exposures to antigenically related strains.       ____    Another preprint ( w hamsters) from a day ago that seems to suggest Omicron specific boosters are likely not going to be effective:       [Replicating RNA platform enables rapid response to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and elicits enhanced protection in na√Øve hamsters compared to ancestral vaccine](https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/sjpvxq/replicating_rna_platform_enables_rapid_response/)
27	Neutral	>With such a huge number of doses administered, I‚Äôm sure just by chance some people had a heart attack or something right after vaccination.  This was brought up by Derek Lowe right before the vaccines got EUA. The title of his post was something like "Get Ready for False Side-Effects".  Edit: Nailed it - https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6rs2r/get_ready_for_false_side_effects/  Second comment on this post is the key point.
23	Agreement	> Yes, that's exactly the comparison.  Wait what? The risk is ‚Äúvaccine myocarditis risk to hospitalised covid-19 patient myocarditis risk‚Äù? I‚Äôm pretty sure when this user says ‚Äúvaccine myocarditis risk‚Äù they‚Äôre talking about vaccine-induced myocarditis which I don‚Äôt think is what this study is about, it‚Äôs about the relative odds of myocarditis after COVID in vaccinated versus unvaccinated patients.
32	Agreement	Absolutely not. Vaccines make many cases much milder. We also have treatments.
326	Disagreement	What you're talking about is not relevant to this study.  As they describe, they took blood serum samples from people and tested those against a neutralization assay.  In their assay, they used pseudoviruses onto which they attached spike proteins from the different variants of SARS-CoV-2.  So their assay specifically tested how well the antibodies in each serum sample, neutralized the spike proteins in each assay.  Most likely this "viral interference" you talk about comes from other factors.  For example, when another virus is detected, interferon is released in the areas where it is detected, which goes into uninfected cells and instructs them to enter the antiviral state. If a lot more of your cells are in this antiviral state at the time that you're exposed to the next virus, then that next virus has less chance of infecting you.  There are other ways the immune system could cause this effect, that's just one example.  Also, *even if* the effect you describe were caused by neutralizing antibodies (which seems very very unlikely, the antibodies induced one virus are unlikely to neutralize a significantly different one), this study compared groups of patients to see statistically significant differences between the groups.  Unless there is some *systematic* reason why, say, more boosted people were likely to have been infected with another virus recently than un-boosted people, then any such infection effects would be random among all groups, and not affect the study results.
924	Agreement	Well I wouldn't want to guess at their motivation too much, but as of [week 2](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1047814/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-2-2022.pdf) they were showing an apparent efficacy of like -100%+ in all cohorts except <18 (recently dosed?) and >80; this phenomenon has been the source of considerable political wrangling between the ONS and the UKHSA (producers of this report).  Soooo... maybe they feel like the 3 dose data isn't quite so embarrassing looking; this is questionable as now it's making the boosters look much worse than I'd expect (and are they even boosting anyone in the <30 cohort?) -- so IDK.   I expect the people on substack will have a field day with it regardless.
105	Agreement	I think we‚Äôre going to find immunity breadth gained through 6-9 months of somatic hypermutation into mature memory B cells and polymorphism of T cell receptors which both have greater affinity to variants will play a larger role than short run neutralizing antibodies which are really primers.
606	Agreement	Against infection. The Pfizer vaccines efficacy against hospitalization is higher, around 90%
235	Agreement	Toms of people out there who‚Äôve never been vaccinated but have been infected. Key point, is they‚Äôre not ruling out infected. Just stand outside a hospital and you‚Äôll find recovered patients who probably are re-thinking their prior decision not to get vaccinated.
997	Disagreement	they die of things like HIV and tuberculosis, yes and the US keeps millions of people alive who are horribly unhealthy and would be dead if not for modern medicine. South Africa for the most part does not have infrastructure or the western medicine we are nearly all accustomed to and they do die of things that would be unthinkable in the west. That doesn‚Äôt make their Covid experience worse than the west‚Äôs experience though in terms of how severe the disease is given the median age of South Africa is <28 vs. ~38 in the US. Additionally, the US has more people over the age of 60 than the entire population of South Africa. ~6% of their population is 65+ vs. ~18% in the US. How much of that 18% would be alive if they were in Africa? The sample size is meaningless when you‚Äôre comparing their population to ours. We‚Äôre obviously quite different. By the numbers, the US has 16x the 65+ age population. Getting stuck on the minutia of these studies thus is pointless.
739	Agreement	Interesting that the study had over 36,000 genomic sequences for patients in the analysis (over 90% of total patients). And the rest that couldn't get sequenced in time for analysis were assumed Omicron through S-gene target failure.  To the best of my knowledge, all other studies on Omicron disease-severity so far rely on variant proportion estimates or S-Gene target failure alone.
273	Agreement	Yes. Heart inflammation (myocarditis or pericarditis) is a known issue with viral diseases, including COVID. Viral myocarditis tends to be severe and has a high rate of permanent heart damage.  In fact, the number one intervention for reducing heart attacks is the flu vaccine. Influenza is also known to trigger heart issues.  Vaccine-associated myocarditis is very rare in all age groups. Your risks from the disease far exceed the rare and treatable vaccine side-effects.
457	Disagreement	is it relatively accepted the shots are safe to keep getting every 4-6 months on a persons own desire? I think eventually they may stop recommending official doses for everyone and just say if you want to continue getting shots just make sure it‚Äôs 4-6 months after your previous one
713	Agreement	I was wondering the same, and am quite dumbfounded they omitted this despite it being a substantial portion of the population still. Anyone know where to find how many total people by age decade had 2 doses in this period? We could at least derive the incidence rates on our own using that and the data from Tables 10-12
3	Neutral	"Conclusion Antibody levels are predictive of the clinical course of COVID-19 in vaccinated patients with delta and omicron variant infections. Our data highlight the need for concentrated efforts to monitor patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at risk of low antibody levels."  I read this as suggesting that in clinical environments, early testing for antibodies can be useful in determining what interventions (like antivirals, for example) would be most valuable.  It isn't surprising that antibody levels are tied to progression of the disease, but I wonder if this suggests that maintaining high antibody titers may be more important in reducing risk of severe outcomes than establishing a robust t-cell response.  Would this have any impact on vaccine strategy as a consequence?
786	Agreement	not one word in the pre-print about masks.
781	Agreement	n=29, and unsurprisingly, the variant that is known to evade antibodies is the prevalent variant.
623	Agreement	Are there any studies about using Astrazeneca as a booster for Johnson?  I got Johnson 7 months ago, but right now there's only Astrazeneca available where I live.
444	Disagreement	Does it mean the (only) effect of the Nth booster is the following three months of being some percent more resistant? It seems like there's no beneficial effect beyond that remaining, is it?  It could explain how several countries procured 4 doses per citizen per year for several years in advance, assuming this was known informally among them and the manufacturer's leadership.
400	Agreement	The nature page isn't loading for me right now. Is the paper about the Original Sin? Any data on how an omicron jab would perform as a first dose?  EDIT: It's loaded:  > The third dose did not produce an elevated immune response against Omicron. But such a response was seen in mice that received one dose of vaccine based on the ancestral strain and two doses of the Omicron-specific vaccine.
856	Agreement	That's so interesting, so the WT vaccine offers some protection from all types of variants, but the specific Omicron vaccine only offers protection from their specific variant.  This reads like movie techno babble where the original strain needs to be found to develop a cure.  More practically, does this suggest that for unvaccinated individuals if you get infected with Omicron first, you are still at risk for another infection from Delta?
915	Agreement	Viral persistence.
30	Agreement	5. They‚Äôre looking at the antibody that is produced by vaccines and not the antibodies produced from natural infection which are more broad. N protein antibodies would give a completely different picture.  6. Not supported by epidemiological data
500	Disagreement	What are imprinting issues, please?
97	Agreement	I don't have a link right now, but from memory the trials didn't show a significant advantage over the original vaccine.
215	Agreement	There are countries where vaccines have not been widely available.
808	Agreement	Probably to some degree,  really depends on the tropism of cells.
389	Agreement	Or in other words, it leads to antibodies that are *much more mutated*?
668	Agreement	For one, risks need to be acknowledged and fears of worst case scenarios accepted as valid. Communication towards people failed miserably in this pandemic with 'you MUST take the vaccine' messaging. With such a huge and relentless campaigning it actually creates opposite effect in some people.
484	Disagreement	The article doesn't seem to mention their ages, were they given the adult dose or a lower dose.  Would there be justification for a dose adjustment for some ages (or maybe some conditions?)
461	Disagreement	It also makes clinical trials (fixed spelling) really challenging here IMO
780	Agreement	My suggestion was for clarification on the statement in general since the authors used vague language to describe causation/risk factors. When I looked up their Mayo Clinic reference, there was no other vaccine listed as a Risk Factor, other than the J&J Covid-19 vaccine. They do list infection with influenza virus as a Risk Factor on their webpage, but not the influenza vaccine.   https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793
508	Neutral	As a layperson who's trying to wrap my head around this, am I correct in my interpretation here: one hypothesis you could draw from this is that given the conditions of these two hearts prior to vaccination, it's possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response would cause a similar reaction and fatality as the vaccine did in this case. In other words, if they hadn't been vaccinated, but had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, they may have died by a very similar mechanism anyway.  Am I getting that right, or missing the point?
121	Agreement	Is this statement accounting for the much longer lag between initial infection and death?
262	Neutral	Would love to see a chart comparing these numbers to prevalence in the population before vaccines and also to those who have had COVID and the unvaccinated.   With such a huge number of doses administered, I‚Äôm sure just by chance some people had a heart attack or something right after vaccination.
65	Agreement	Did the researchers examine differences in immunity based on time since last dose independent of whether it was the 2nd or 3rd shot?
783	Agreement	not "qualified", but I can share my understanding as I'm reading though Janeway's Immunobiology and [The Lifespan of short-lived plasma cells](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/116/18/3445/27964/The-life-span-of-short-lived-plasma-cells-is)   antibodies are produced by plasma cells.   there's a primary and secondary response (with secondary being more differentiated), but of these only a subset migrate to the bone marrow - where stromal cells keep these long lived plasma cells alive.   Plasma cells that aren't selected for migration end up dying and are cycled out. This has to do with capase-3 and 9, which I don't fully understand, but also endoplasmic reticulum stress signals for capase-12 (if my understanding is correct, it basically means the cellular machinery of the plasma cell gets worn out and that triggers programed cell death).  my understanding is that high volume of antibodies is only temporary, a low level can be maintained from the migrated long lived plasma cells for years. But prolonged high levels of antibodies can lead to hyperviscosity syndrome - where the blood becomes more viscous, which makes a number of organ processess harder.   &#x200B;  upon reexposure, memory B differentiate and produce effector cells, which results in more plasma cells producing the high volume of antibodies again.
822	Agreement	Severity of infection determines how long the t-cell immunity lasts. I always find it disconcerting when "level of immunity" is suggested to provide "level of protection". The vaccines and boosters are the most accurate form of determining the waning immunity without costly bAB titer count tests.  Those terms always seem to get misunderstood when it goes to press.  The only protection from infection is wearing a fitted mask and goggles.
868	Agreement	The last data in this study is only 2 weeks post vaccination #3, so this particular study is not useful to answer that question.  It's not clear if they're continuing to follow their cohort and will publish an update at some point.  Unfortunately, there's basically no way to accelerate research into how long a particular immune response will last.
583	Agreement	91-150 looks strongly negative. If 150+ would be positive or zero in this study that would be a *good* result.
138	Agreement	It's pretty big by Phase 1 standards. It would be nice if Cohort 2 was bigger, but I think this study just look at antibody generation, not protection against actual infection, so it doesn't need to be nearly as large as the Phase 3 trials.
