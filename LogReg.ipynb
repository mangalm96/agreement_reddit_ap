Objective : estimate BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness COVID cases hospitalizations among children 5-11 years 12-17 years December , 2021 January , 2022 . Design : Analyses cohorts constructed linked statewide immunization , laboratory testing , hospitalization databases . Setting/Participants : New York State children 5-17 years . Main outcomes/measures : New laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalizations . Comparisons made using incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) , comparing outcomes vaccination status , estimated vaccine effectiveness ( : 1- [ 1/IRR ] ) . Results : December 13 , 2021 January 30 , 2022 , among 852,384 fully-vaccinated children 12-17 years 365,502 children 5-11 years , cases declined 66 % ( 95 % CI : 64 % , 67 % ) 51 % ( 95 % CI : 48 % , 54 % ) 12-17 years 68 % ( 95 % CI : 63 % , 72 % ) 12 % ( 95 % CI : 6 % , 16 % ) 5-11 years .
